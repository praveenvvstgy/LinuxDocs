     DESCRIPTION
    </h2>
    <p>
     Section 1 of the manual describes user commands and tools,
      for example, file manipulation tools, shells, compilers, web
      browsers, file and image viewers and editors, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
     All commands yield a status value on termination. This
      value can be tested (e.g., in most shells the variable
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       $?
      </code>
     </em>
     contains the
      status of the last executed command) to see whether the
      command completed successfully. A zero exit status is
      conventionally used to indicate success, and a nonzero status
      means that the command was unsuccessful. (Details of the exit
      status can be found in
     <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/wait.2.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
      <span class="citerefentry">

        wait
       </span>
       (2)
      </span>
     </a>
     .) A nonzero exit
      status can be in the range 1 to 255, and some commands use
      different nonzero status values to indicate the reason why
      the command failed.

     NOTES
    </h2>
    <p>
     Linux is a flavor of UNIX, and as a first approximation
      all user commands under UNIX work precisely the same under
      Linux (and FreeBSD and lots of other UNIX-like systems).
    </p>
    <p>
     Under Linux, there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces),
      where you can point and click and drag, and hopefully get
      work done without first reading lots of documentation. The
      traditional UNIX environment is a CLI (command line
      interface), where you type commands to tell the computer what
      to do. That is faster and more powerful, but requires finding
      out what the commands are. Below a bare minimum, to get
      started.

      Login
     </h3>
     <p>
      In order to start working, you probably first have to
        login, that is, give your username and password. See also

        a screen with menus or icons and a mouse click will start a
        shell in a window. See also

      here was the command
        prompt&mdash;it is the shell's way of indicating that it is
        ready for the next command. The prompt can be customized in
        lots of ways, and one might include stuff like username,
        machine name, current directory, time, and so on. An
        assignment PS1="What next, master? " would change the
        prompt as indicated.

     <p>
      We see that there are commands
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        date
       </strong>
      </span>
      (that gives date and
        time), and
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        cal
       </strong>
      </span>
      (that gives a
        calendar).
     </p>
     <p>
      The command
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        ls
       </strong>
      </span>
      lists the contents of
        the current directory&mdash;it tells you what files you
        have. With a
      <code class="option">
       &minus;l
      </code>
      option it
        gives a long listing, that includes the owner and size and
        date of the file, and the permissions people have for
        reading and/or changing the file. For example, the file
        "tel" here is 37 bytes long, owned by aeb and the owner can
        read and write it, others can only read it. Owner and
        permissions can be changed by the commands
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        chown
       </strong>
      </span>
      and
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        chmod
       </strong>
      </span>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      The command
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        cat
       </strong>
      </span>
      will show the
        contents of a file. (The name is from "concatenate and
        print": all files given as parameters are concatenated and
        sent to "standard output", here the terminal screen.)
     </p>
     <p>
      The command
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        cp
       </strong>
      </span>
      (from "copy") will
        copy a file. On the other hand, the command
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        mv
       </strong>
      </span>
      (from "move") only
        renames it.
     </p>
     <p>
      The command
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        diff
       </strong>
      </span>
      lists the
        differences between two files. Here there was no output
        because there were no differences.
     </p>
     <p>
      The command
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        rm
       </strong>
      </span>
      (from "remove")
        deletes the file, and be careful! it is gone. No wastepaper
        basket or anything. Deleted means lost.
     </p>
     <p>
      The command
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        grep
       </strong>
      </span>
      (from "g/re/p")
        finds occurrences of a string in one or more files. Here it
        finds Maja's telephone number.

     <h3>
      Pathnames and the current directory
     </h3>
     <p>
      Files live in a large tree, the file hierarchy. Each has
        a
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        pathname
       </code>
      </em>
      describing the path from the root of the tree (which is
        called /) to the file. For example, such a full pathname
        might be /home/aeb/tel. Always using full pathnames would
        be inconvenient, and the name of a file in the current
        directory may be abbreviated by giving only the last
        component. That is why "/home/aeb/tel" can be abbreviated
        to "tel" when the current directory is "/home/aeb".

      The command

       <strong>

      The command

      The command

       <strong>
        find
       </strong>
      </span>
      (with a rather
        baroque syntax) will find files with given name or other
        properties. For example, "find . &minus;name tel" would
        find the file "tel" starting in the present directory
        (which is called "."). And "find / &minus;name tel" would
        do the same, but starting at the root of the tree. Large
        searches on a multi-GB disk will be time-consuming, and it

      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        kill
       </strong>
      </span>
      allows you to get
        rid of them. Without option this is a friendly request:
        please go away. And "kill &minus;9" followed by the number
        of the process is an immediate kill. Foreground processes
        can often be killed by typing Control-C.

     <h3>
      Getting information
     </h3>
     <p>
      There are thousands of commands, each with many options.
        Traditionally commands are documented on
      <span class="emphasis">
       <em>
        man pages
       </em>
      </span>
      , (like this one), so
        that the command "man kill" will document the use of the
        command "kill" (and "man man" document the command "man").
        The program
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        man
       </strong>
      </span>
      sends the text
        through some
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        pager
       </strong>
      </span>
      , usually
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        less
       </strong>
      </span>
      . Hit the
        space bar to get the next page, hit q to quit.
     </p>
     <p>
      In documentation it is customary to refer to man pages
        by giving the name and section number, as in
      <span class="citerefentry">
       <span class="refentrytitle">
        man
       </span>
       (1)
      </span>
      . Man pages are terse,
        and allow you to find quickly some forgotten detail. For
        newcomers an introductory text with more examples and
        explanations is useful.

      A lot of GNU/FSF software is provided with info files.
