     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcregrep
      </strong>
     </span>
     searches files for character patterns, in the same way as
      other grep commands do, but it uses the PCRE regular
      expression library to support patterns that are compatible
      with the regular expressions of Perl 5. See
     <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcresyntax.3.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
      <span class="citerefentry">
       <span class="refentrytitle">

       </span>
       (3)
      </span>
     </a>
     for a
      quick-reference summary of pattern syntax, or
     <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrepattern.3.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
      <span class="citerefentry">
       <span class="refentrytitle">
        pcrepattern
       </span>
       (3)
      </span>
     </a>
     for a full
      description of the syntax and semantics of the regular
      expressions that PCRE supports.
    </p>
    <p>
     Patterns, whether supplied on the command line or in a
      separate file, are given without delimiters. For example:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
pcregrep Thursday /etc/motd
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     If you attempt to use delimiters (for example, by
      surrounding a pattern with slashes, as is common in Perl
      scripts), they are interpreted as part of the pattern. Quotes
      can of course be used to delimit patterns on the command line
      because they are interpreted by the shell, and indeed quotes
      are required if a pattern contains white space or shell
      metacharacters.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first argument that follows any option settings is
      treated as the single pattern to be matched when neither
     <code class="option">
      &minus;e
     </code>
     nor
     <code class="option">
      &minus;f
     </code>
     is present. Conversely, when one or
      both of these options are used to specify patterns, all
      arguments are treated as path names. At least one of
     <code class="option">
      &minus;e
     </code>
     ,
     <code class="option">
      &minus;f
     </code>
     , or an argument pattern must be
      provided.
    </p>
    <p>
     If no files are specified,
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcregrep
      </strong>
     </span>
     reads the standard
      input. The standard input can also be referenced by a name
      consisting of a single hyphen. For example:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
pcregrep some-pattern /file1 - /file3
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     By default, each line that matches a pattern is copied to
      the standard output, and if there is more than one file, the
      file name is output at the start of each line, followed by a
      colon. However, there are options that can change how
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcregrep
      </strong>
     </span>
     behaves. In particular, the
     <code class="option">
      &minus;M
     </code>
     option makes it possible to search
      for patterns that span line boundaries. What defines a line
      boundary is controlled by the
     <code class="option">
      &minus;N
     </code>
     (
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;newline
     </code>
     ) option.
    </p>
    <p>
     The amount of memory used for buffering files that are
      being scanned is controlled by a parameter that can be set by
      the
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;buffer&minus;size
     </code>
     option. The
      default value for this parameter is specified when
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcregrep
      </strong>
     </span>
     is
      built, with the default default being 20K. A block of memory
      three times this size is used (to allow for buffering
      "before" and "after" lines). An error occurs if a line
      overflows the buffer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Patterns can be no longer than 8K or BUFSIZ bytes,
      whichever is the greater. BUFSIZ is defined in
     <code class="literal">
      &lt;
     </code>
     <code class="filename">
      stdio.h
     </code>
     <code class="literal">
      &gt;
     </code>
     When there is more than one pattern (specified by the use of
     <code class="option">
      &minus;e
     </code>
     and/or
     <code class="option">
      &minus;f
     </code>
     ), each pattern is applied to each
      line in the order in which they are defined, except that all
      the
     <code class="option">
      &minus;e
     </code>
     patterns are tried
      before the
     <code class="option">
      &minus;f
     </code>
     patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
     By default, as soon as one pattern matches a line, no
      further patterns are considered. However, if
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;colour
     </code>
     (or
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;color
     </code>
     ) is used to colour the
      matching substrings, or if
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;only&minus;matching
     </code>
     ,
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;file&minus;offsets
     </code>
     ,
      or
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;line&minus;offsets
     </code>
     is used to
      output only the part of the line that matched (either shown
      literally, or as an offset), scanning resumes immediately
      following the match, so that further matches on the same line
      can be found. If there are multiple patterns, they are all
      tried on the remainder of the line, but patterns that follow
      the one that matched are not tried on the earlier part of the
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
     This behaviour means that the order in which multiple
      patterns are specified can affect the output when one of the
      above options is used. This is no longer the same behaviour
      as GNU grep, which now manages to display earlier matches for
      later patterns (as long as there is no overlap).
    </p>
    <p>
     Patterns that can match an empty string are accepted, but
      empty string matches are never recognized. An example is the
      pattern "(super)?(man)?", in which all components are
      optional. This pattern finds all occurrences of both "super"
      and "man"; the output differs from matching with "super|man"
      when only the matching substrings are being shown.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the
     <code class="constant">
      LC_ALL
     </code>
     or
     <code class="constant">
      LC_CTYPE

     environment variable
      is set,
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcregrep

     uses the value to
      set a locale when calling the PCRE library. The
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;locale
     </code>
     option can be used to
      override this.

     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;help

     BINARY FILES
    </h2>
    <p>
     By default, a file that contains a binary zero byte within
      the first 1024 bytes is identified as a binary file, and is
      processed specially. (GNU grep also identifies binary files
      in this manner.) See the
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;binary&minus;files
     </code>
     option for a
      means of changing the way binary files are handled.

    <h2>
     OPTIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
     The order in which some of the options appear can affect
      the output. For example, both the
     <code class="option">
      &minus;h
     </code>
     and
     <code class="option">
      &minus;l
     </code>
     options affect the printing of file
      names. Whichever comes later in the command line will be the
      one that takes effect. Similarly, except where noted below,
      if an option is given twice, the later setting is used.
      Numerical values for options may be followed by K or M, to
      signify multiplication by 1024 or 1024*1024 respectively.

        This terminates the list of options. It is useful if

        This option specifies under what circumstances the
            parts of a line that matched a pattern should be
            coloured in the output. By default, the output is not
            coloured. The value (which is optional, see above) may
            be "never", "always", or "auto". In the latter case,
            colouring happens only if the standard output is
            connected to a terminal. More resources are used when
            colouring is enabled, because
        <span class="command">
         <strong>
          pcregrep
         </strong>
        </span>
        has to
            search for all possible matches in a line, not just
            one, in order to colour them all.
       </p>
       <p>
        The colour that is used can be specified by setting
            the environment variable PCREGREP_COLOUR or
            PCREGREP_COLOR. The value of this variable should be a
            string of two numbers, separated by a semicolon. They
            are copied directly into the control string for setting
            colour on a terminal, so it is your responsibility to
            ensure that they make sense. If neither of the
            environment variables is set, the default is "1;31",
            which gives red.

            an immediate end-of-file; in others it may provoke an

        Processing some regular expression patterns can

            Other patterns may take a very long time to search for
            all possible matching strings. The

        The

         &minus;&minus;match&minus;limit

        option
            provides a means of limiting resource usage when
            processing patterns that are not going to match, but
            which have a very large number of possibilities in
            their search trees. The classic example is a pattern
            that uses nested unlimited repeats. Internally, PCRE
            uses a function called
        <code class="function">
         match
        </code>
        () which it calls repeatedly
            (sometimes recursively). The limit set by
        <code class="option">
         &minus;&minus;match&minus;limit
        </code>
        is
            imposed on the number of times this function is called
            during a match, which has the effect of limiting the
            amount of backtracking that can take place.

        <code class="option">

        () is called, it
            limits the depth of recursive calls, which in turn
            limits the amount of memory that can be used. The
            recursion depth is a smaller number than the total
            number of calls, because not all calls to
        <code class="function">
         match
        </code>
        () are recursive. This limit is
            of use only if it is set smaller than

        There are no short forms for these options. The
            default settings are specified when the PCRE library is
            compiled, with the default default being 10
            million.

        Allow patterns to match more than one line. When

            literal newline characters and internal occurrences of
            ^ and $ characters. The output for a successful match
            may consist of more than one line, the last of which is
            the one in which the match ended. If the matched string
            ends with a newline sequence the output ends at the end

        When this option is set, the PCRE library is called
            in "multiline" mode. There is a limit to the number of
            lines that can be matched, imposed by the way that
        <span class="command">
         <strong>
          pcregrep

        buffers the input file as it scans it. However,
        <span class="command">
         <strong>
          pcregrep
         </strong>
        </span>
        ensures that at least 8K characters or the rest of the
            document (whichever is the shorter) are available for
            forward matching, and similarly the previous 8K
            characters (or all the previous characters, if fewer
            than 8K) are guaranteed to be available for lookbehind
            assertions. This option does not work when input is

        The PCRE library supports five different conventions
            for indicating the ends of lines. They are the
            single-character sequences CR (carriage return) and LF
            (linefeed), the two-character sequence CRLF, an
            "anycrlf" convention, which recognizes any of the
            preceding three types, and an "any" convention, in
            which any Unicode line ending sequence is assumed to
            end a line. The Unicode sequences are the three just
            mentioned, plus VT (vertical tab, U+000B), FF (form
            feed, U+000C), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line
            separator, U+2028), and PS (paragraph separator,
            U+2029).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the PCRE library is built, a default
            line-ending sequence is specified. This is normally the
            standard sequence for the operating system. Unless
            otherwise specified by this option,
        <span class="command">
         <strong>
          pcregrep
         </strong>
        </span>
        uses the
            library's default. The possible values for this option
            are CR, LF, CRLF, ANYCRLF, or ANY. This makes it
            possible to use
        <span class="command">
         <strong>
          pcregrep
         </strong>
        </span>
        to scan
            files that have come from other environments without
            having to modify their line endings. If the data that
            is being scanned does not agree with the convention set
            by this option,
        <span class="command">
         <strong>
          pcregrep
         </strong>
        </span>

        Show only the part of the line that matched the

        <code class="option">

        without a number. Because these options can be given
            without an argument (see above), if an argument is
            present, it must be given in the same shell item, for
            example, -o3 or --only-matching=2. The comments given
            for the non-argument case above also apply to this
            case. If the specified capturing parentheses do not
            exist in the pattern, or were not set in the match,

     to
      scan files with different newline conventions from the

      standard output are copied identically, with whatever newline
      sequences they have in the input. However, the setting of
      this option does not affect the interpretation of files

      <strong>

     , as is the use of

     <span class="command">

     </span>
     . For example, the
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;include
     </code>
     option's
      argument is a glob for GNU
     <span class="command">
      <strong>

      expression for
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcregrep
      </strong>
     </span>
     . If both the

     </code>
     and
     <code class="option">
      &minus;l
     </code>
     options are given, GNU grep lists
      only file names, without counts, but
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcregrep
      </strong>
     </span>
     gives the
      counts.

    <h2>
     OPTIONS WITH DATA
    </h2>
    <p>
     There are four different ways in which an option with data
      can be specified. If a short form option is used, the data
      may follow immediately, or (with one exception) in the next
      command line item. For example:
    </p>
    <div class="variablelist">
     <dl class="variablelist">
      <dt>
       <span class="term">
        <code class="option">
         &minus;f
        </code>
        /some/file,
        <code class="option">
         &minus;f
        </code>
        /some/file
       </span>
      </dt>
      <dd>
       <p>
        The exception is the
        <code class="option">
         &minus;o
        </code>
        option, which may appear with
            or without data. Because of this, if data is present,
            it must follow immediately in the same item, for
            example -o3.
       </p>
      </dd>
     </dl>
    </div>
    <p>
     If a long form option is used, the data may appear in the
      same command line item, separated by an equals character, or
      (with two exceptions) it may appear in the next command line
      item. For example:
    </p>
    <div class="variablelist">
     <dl class="variablelist">
      <dt>
       <span class="term">
        <code class="option">
         &minus;f
        </code>
        /some/file,
        <code class="option">
         &minus;f
        </code>
        /some/file
       </span>
      </dt>
      <dd>
       <p>
        Note, however, that if you want to supply a file
            name beginning with ~ as data in a shell command, and
            have the shell expand ~ to a home directory, you must
            separate the file name from the option, because the
            shell does not treat ~ specially unless it is at the
            start of an item.
       </p>
      </dd>
     </dl>
    </div>
    <p>
     The exceptions to the above are the
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;colour
     </code>
     (or
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;color
     </code>
     ) and
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;only&minus;matching
     </code>
     options,
      for which the data is optional. If one of these options does
      have data, it must be given in the first form, using an
      equals character. Otherwise
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcregrep
      </strong>
     </span>
     will assume that
      it has no data.

    <h2>
     MATCHING ERRORS
    </h2>
    <p>
     It is possible to supply a regular expression that takes a
      very long time to fail to match certain lines. Such patterns
      normally involve nested indefinite repeats, for example:
      (a+)*\d when matched against a line of a's with no final
      digit. The PCRE matching function has a resource limit that
      causes it to abort in these circumstances. If this happens,
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcregrep
      </strong>
     </span>
     outputs an error message and the line that caused the problem
      to the standard error stream. If there are more than 20 such
      errors,
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcregrep
      </strong>
     </span>
     gives up.
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;match&minus;limit
     </code>
     option of
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcregrep
      </strong>
     </span>
     can be
      used to set the overall resource limit; there is a second
      option called
     <code class="option">
      &minus;&minus;recursion&minus;limit
     </code>
     that sets
      a limit on the amount of memory (usually stack) that is used
      (see the discussion of these options above).

     Exit status is 0 if any matches were found, 1 if no
      matches were found, and 2 for syntax errors, overlong lines,
      non-existent or inaccessible files (even if matches were
      found in other files) or too many matching errors. Using the
     <code class="option">
      &minus;s
     </code>
     option to suppress error
      messages about inaccessible files does not affect the return
      code.
