     DESCRIPTION
    </h2>
    <p>
     Some UNIX/Linux system calls have as parameter one or more
      filenames. A filename (or pathname) is resolved as
      follows.
    </p>
    <div class="refsect2">

     <h3>
      Step 1: start of the resolution process
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the pathname starts with the '/' character, the
        starting lookup directory is the root directory of the
        calling process. (A process inherits its root directory
        from its parent. Usually this will be the root directory of
        the file hierarchy. A process may get a different root
        directory by use of the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/chroot.2.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">
        <span class="refentrytitle">
         chroot
        </span>
        (2)
       </span>
      </a>
      system call. A
        process may get an entirely private mount namespace in case
        it&mdash;or one of its ancestors&mdash;was started by an
        invocation of the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/clone.2.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">
        <span class="refentrytitle">
         clone
        </span>
        (2)
       </span>
      </a>
      system call that
        had the
      <code class="constant">
       CLONE_NEWNS
      </code>
      flag
        set.) This handles the '/' part of the pathname.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the pathname does not start with the '/' character,
        the starting lookup directory of the resolution process is
        the current working directory of the process. (This is also
        inherited from the parent. It can be changed by use of the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/chdir.2.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">
        <span class="refentrytitle">

        </span>
        (2)
       </span>
      </a>
      system
        call.)
     </p>
     <p>
      Pathnames starting with a '/' character are called
        absolute pathnames. Pathnames not starting with a '/' are
        called relative pathnames.

     <h3>
      Step 2: walk along the path
     </h3>
     <p>
      Set the current lookup directory to the starting lookup
        directory. Now, for each nonfinal component of the
        pathname, where a component is a substring delimited by '/'
        characters, this component is looked up in the current
        lookup directory.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the process does not have search permission on the
        current lookup directory, an
      <span class="errorname">
       EACCES
      </span>
      error is returned ("Permission
        denied").
     </p>
     <p>
      If the component is not found, an
      <span class="errorname">
       ENOENT
      </span>
      error is returned ("No such file
        or directory").
     </p>
     <p>
      If the component is found, but is neither a directory
        nor a symbolic link, an
      <span class="errorname">
       ENOTDIR
      </span>
      error is returned ("Not a
        directory").
     </p>
     <p>
      If the component is found and is a directory, we set the
        current lookup directory to that directory, and go to the
        next component.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the component is found and is a symbolic link
        (symlink), we first resolve this symbolic link (with the
        current lookup directory as starting lookup directory).
        Upon error, that error is returned. If the result is not a
        directory, an
      <span class="errorname">
       ENOTDIR
      </span>
      error
        is returned. If the resolution of the symlink is successful
        and returns a directory, we set the current lookup
        directory to that directory, and go to the next component.
        Note that the resolution process here involves recursion.
        In order to protect the kernel against stack overflow, and
        also to protect against denial of service, there are limits
        on the maximum recursion depth, and on the maximum number
        of symbolic links followed. An
      <span class="errorname">
       ELOOP
      </span>
      error is returned when the maximum
        is exceeded ("Too many levels of symbolic links").

     <h3>
      Step 3: find the final entry
     </h3>
     <p>
      The lookup of the final component of the pathname goes
        just like that of all other components, as described in the
        previous step, with two differences: (i) the final
        component need not be a directory (at least as far as the
        path resolution process is concerned&mdash;it may have to
        be a directory, or a nondirectory, because of the
        requirements of the specific system call), and (ii) it is
        not necessarily an error if the component is not
        found&mdash;maybe we are just creating it. The details on
        the treatment of the final entry are described in the
        manual pages of the specific system calls.

     <h3>
      . and ..
     </h3>
     <p>
      By convention, every directory has the entries "." and
        "..", which refer to the directory itself and to its parent
        directory, respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      The path resolution process will assume that these
        entries have their conventional meanings, regardless of
        whether they are actually present in the physical
        filesystem.
     </p>
     <p>
      One cannot walk down past the root: "/.." is the same as
        "/".

     <h3>
      Mount points
     </h3>
     <p>
      After a "mount dev path" command, the pathname "path"
        refers to the root of the filesystem hierarchy on the
        device "dev", and no longer to whatever it referred to
        earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      One can walk out of a mounted filesystem: "path/.."
        refers to the parent directory of "path", outside of the
        filesystem hierarchy on "dev".

     <h3>
      Trailing slashes
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a pathname ends in a '/', that forces resolution of
        the preceding component as in Step 2: it has to exist and
        resolve to a directory. Otherwise, a trailing '/' is
        ignored. (Or, equivalently, a pathname with a trailing '/'
        is equivalent to the pathname obtained by appending '.' to
        it.)

     <h3>
      Final symlink
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the last component of a pathname is a symbolic link,
        then it depends on the system call whether the file
        referred to will be the symbolic link or the result of path
        resolution on its contents. For example, the system call
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/stat.2.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">
        <span class="refentrytitle">
         lstat
        </span>
        (2)
       </span>
      </a>
      will operate on
        the symlink, while
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/stat.2.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">
        <span class="refentrytitle">
         stat
        </span>
        (2)
       </span>
      </a>
      operates on the
        file pointed to by the symlink.

     <h3>
      Length limit
     </h3>
     <p>
      There is a maximum length for pathnames. If the pathname
        (or some intermediate pathname obtained while resolving
        symbolic links) is too long, an
      <span class="errorname">
       ENAMETOOLONG

      error is returned

     <h3>
      Empty pathname
     </h3>
     <p>
      In the original UNIX, the empty pathname referred to the
        current directory. Nowadays POSIX decrees that an empty
        pathname must not be resolved successfully. Linux returns
      <span class="errorname">
       ENOENT
      </span>
      in this case.

     <h3>
      Permissions
     </h3>
     <p>
      The permission bits of a file consist of three groups of
        three bits, cf.
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman1/chmod.1.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">
        <span class="refentrytitle">

      </a>
      and
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/stat.2.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">
        <span class="refentrytitle">
         stat
        </span>
        (2)
       </span>
      </a>
      . The first group
        of three is used when the effective user ID of the calling
        process equals the owner ID of the file. The second group
        of three is used when the group ID of the file either
        equals the effective group ID of the calling process, or is
        one of the supplementary group IDs of the calling process
        (as set by
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/getgroups.2.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">
        <span class="refentrytitle">
         setgroups
        </span>
        (2)
       </span>
      </a>
      ). When
        neither holds, the third group is used.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of the three bits used, the first bit determines read
        permission, the second write permission, and the last
        execute permission in case of ordinary files, or search
        permission in case of directories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Linux uses the fsuid instead of the effective user ID in
        permission checks. Ordinarily the fsuid will equal the
        effective user ID, but the fsuid can be changed by the
        system call
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/setfsuid.2.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">

       </span>
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      (Here "fsuid" stands for something like "filesystem user
        ID". The concept was required for the implementation of a
        user space NFS server at a time when processes could send a
        signal to a process with the same effective user ID. It is
        obsolete now. Nobody should use

      </a>
      .)
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, Linux uses the fsgid ("filesystem group ID")
        instead of the effective group ID. See

      Bypassing permission checks: superuser and

     <p>
      On a traditional UNIX system, the superuser (
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        root
       </code>
      </em>
      , user ID 0) is
        all-powerful, and bypasses all permissions restrictions
        when accessing files.
     </p>
     <p>
      On Linux, superuser privileges are divided into
        capabilities (see
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman7/capabilities.7.html" shape="rect" target="_top">

        capabilities are relevant for file permissions checks:
      <code class="constant">

      and
      <code class="constant">
       CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH

      . (A

     <p>
      The
      <code class="constant">

      capability overrides all permission checking, but grants
        execute permission only when at least one of the file's

     <p>
      The
