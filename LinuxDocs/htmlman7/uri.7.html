     DESCRIPTION
    </h2>
    <p>
     A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a short string of
      characters identifying an abstract or physical resource (for
      example, a web page). A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a
      URI that identifies a resource through its primary access
      mechanism (e.g., its network "location"), rather than by name
      or some other attribute of that resource. A Uniform Resource
      Name (URN) is a URI that must remain globally unique and
      persistent even when the resource ceases to exist or becomes
      unavailable.
    </p>
    <p>
     URIs are the standard way to name hypertext link
      destinations for tools such as web browsers. The string
      "http://www.kernelnotes.org" is a URL (and thus it is also a
      URI). Many people use the term URL loosely as a synonym for
      URI (though technically URLs are a subset of URIs).
    </p>
    <p>
     URIs can be absolute or relative. An absolute identifier
      refers to a resource independent of context, while a relative
      identifier refers to a resource by describing the difference
      from the current context. Within a relative path reference,
      the complete path segments "." and ".." have special
      meanings: "the current hierarchy level" and "the level above
      this hierarchy level", respectively, just like they do in
      UNIX-like systems. A path segment which contains a colon
      character can't be used as the first segment of a relative
      URI path (e.g., "this:that"), because it would be mistaken
      for a scheme name; precede such segments with ./ (e.g.,
      "./this:that"). Note that descendants of MS-DOS (e.g.,
      Microsoft Windows) replace devicename colons with the
      vertical bar ("|") in URIs, so "C:" becomes "C|".
    </p>
    <p>
     A fragment identifier, if included, refers to a particular
      named portion (fragment) of a resource; text after a '#'
      identifies the fragment. A URI beginning with '#' refers to
      that fragment in the current resource.

     <h3>
      Usage
     </h3>
     <p>
      There are many different URI schemes, each with specific
        additional rules and meanings, but they are intentionally
        made to be as similar as possible. For example, many URL
        schemes permit the authority to be the following format,
        called here an
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        ip_server
       </code>
      </em>
      (square brackets
        show what's optional):
     </p>
     <p>
      <span class="emphasis">
       <em>
        ip_server
        =
       </em>
      </span>
      [
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        user
       </code>
      </em>
      [ :
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        password
       </code>
      </em>
      ] @ ]
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        host
       </code>
      </em>
      [ :
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        port
       </code>
      </em>
      ]
     </p>
     <p>
      This format allows you to optionally insert a username,
        a user plus password, and/or a port number. The
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        host
       </code>
      </em>
      is the name of the
        host computer, either its name as determined by DNS or an
        IP address (numbers separated by periods). Thus the URI
        &lt;
      <a class="literalurl" href="http://fred:fredpassword@xyz.com:8080/" shape="rect" target="_top">
       http://fred:fredpassword@xyz.com:8080/
      </a>
      &gt; logs
        into a web server on host xyz.com as fred (using
        fredpassword) using port 8080. Avoid including a password
        in a URI if possible because of the many security risks of
        having a password written down. If the URL supplies a
        username but no password, and the remote server requests a
        password, the program interpreting the URL should request
        one from the user.
     </p>
     <p>
      Here are some of the most common schemes in use on
        UNIX-like systems that are understood by many tools. Note
        that many tools using URIs also have internal schemes or
        specialized schemes; see those tools' documentation for
        information on those schemes.

     <p>
      This is a URL accessing a web (HTTP) server. The default
        port is 80. If the path refers to a directory, the web
        server will choose what to return; usually if there is a
        file named "index.html" or "index.htm" its content is
        returned, otherwise, a list of the files in the current
        directory (with appropriate links) is generated and
        returned. An example is &lt;
      <a class="literalurl" href="http://lwn.net" shape="rect" target="_top">
       http://lwn.net
      </a>
      &gt;.
     </p>
     <p>
      A query can be given in the archaic "isindex" format,
        consisting of a word or phrase and not including an equal
        sign (=). A query can also be in the longer "GET" format,
        which has one or more query entries of the form
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        key
       </code>
      </em>
      =
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        value
       </code>
      </em>
      separated by the
        ampersand character (&amp;). Note that
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        key
       </code>
      </em>
      can be repeated more
        than once, though it's up to the web server and its
        application programs to determine if there's any meaning to
        that. There is an unfortunate interaction with
        HTML/XML/SGML and the GET query format; when such URIs with
        more than one key are embedded in SGML/XML documents
        (including HTML), the ampersand (&amp;) has to be rewritten
        as &amp;amp;. Note that not all queries use this format;
        larger forms may be too long to store as a URI, so they use
        a different interaction mechanism (called POST) which does
        not include the data in the URI. See the Common Gateway
        Interface specification at

      can be the string

        the path is to a directory, the viewer should display the
        directory's contents with links to each containee; not all
        viewers currently do this. KDE supports generated files
        through the URL &lt;file:/cgi-bin&gt;. If the given file
        isn't found, browser writers may want to try to expand the
        filename via filename globbing (see
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman7/glob.7.html" shape="rect" target="_top">

      ).
     </p>
     <p>
      The second format (e.g., &lt;file:/etc/passwd&gt;) is a
        correct format for referring to a local file. However,
        older standards did not permit this format, and some
        programs don't recognize this as a URI. A more portable
        syntax is to use an empty string as the server name, for
        example, &lt;file:///etc/passwd&gt;; this form does the
        same thing and is easily recognized by pattern matchers and
        older programs as a URI. Note that if you really mean to
        say "start from the current location," don't specify the
        scheme at all; use a relative address like
        &lt;../test.txt&gt;, which has the side-effect of being
        scheme-independent. An example of this scheme is
        &lt;file:///etc/passwd&gt;.

      This scheme refers to online info reference pages
        (generated from texinfo files), a documentation format used
        by programs such as the GNU tools. This URI scheme is
        unique to UNIX-like systems (such as Linux) and is not
        currently registered by the IETF. As of this writing, GNOME
        and KDE differ in their URI syntax and do not accept the
        other's syntax. The first two formats are the GNOME format;
        in nodenames all spaces are written as underscores. The
        second two formats are the KDE format; spaces in nodenames
        must be written as spaces, even though this is forbidden by
        the URI standards. It's hoped that in the future most tools
        will understand all of these formats and will always accept
        underscores for spaces in nodenames. In both GNOME and KDE,
        if the form without the nodename is used the nodename is
        assumed to be "Top". Examples of the GNOME format are
        &lt;info:gcc&gt; and &lt;info:gcc#G++_and_GCC&gt;. Examples
        of the KDE format are &lt;info:(gcc)&gt; and
        &lt;info:(gcc)G++ and GCC&gt;.

      There are many other URI schemes. Most tools that accept
        URIs support a set of internal URIs (e.g., Mozilla has the
        about: scheme for internal information, and the GNOME help
        browser has the toc: scheme for various starting
        locations). There are many schemes that have been defined
        but are not as widely used at the current time (e.g.,
        prospero). The nntp: scheme is deprecated in favor of the
        news: scheme. URNs are to be supported by the urn: scheme,
        with a hierarchical name space (e.g., urn:ietf:... would
        identify IETF documents); at this time URNs are not widely
        implemented. Not all tools support all schemes.

     <h3>
      Character encoding
     </h3>
     <p>
      URIs use a limited number of characters so that they can
        be typed in and used in a variety of situations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The following characters are reserved, that is, they may
        appear in a URI but their use is limited to their reserved
        purpose (conflicting data must be escaped before forming
        the URI):
     </p>
     <div class="itemizedlist">
      <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc;">
       <li class="listitem">
        <p>
         ; / ? : @ &amp; = + $ ,
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
     </div>
     <p>
      Unreserved characters may be included in a URI.
        Unreserved characters include uppercase and lowercase
        English letters, decimal digits, and the following limited
        set of punctuation marks and symbols:
     </p>
     <div class="itemizedlist">
      <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc;">
       <li class="listitem">
        <p>
         &minus; _ . ! ~ * ' ( )
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
     </div>
     <p>
      All other characters must be escaped. An escaped octet
        is encoded as a character triplet, consisting of the
        percent character "%" followed by the two hexadecimal
        digits representing the octet code (you can use uppercase
        or lowercase letters for the hexadecimal digits). For
        example, a blank space must be escaped as "%20", a tab
        character as "%09", and the "&amp;" as "%26". Because the
        percent "%" character always has the reserved purpose of
        being the escape indicator, it must be escaped as "%25". It
        is common practice to escape space characters as the plus
        symbol (+) in query text; this practice isn't uniformly
        defined in the relevant RFCs (which recommend %20 instead)
        but any tool accepting URIs with query text should be
        prepared for them. A URI is always shown in its "escaped"
        form.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unreserved characters can be escaped without changing
        the semantics of the URI, but this should not be done
        unless the URI is being used in a context that does not
        allow the unescaped character to appear. For example, "%7e"
        is sometimes used instead of "~" in an HTTP URL path, but
        the two are equivalent for an HTTP URL.
     </p>
     <p>
      For URIs which must handle characters outside the US
        ASCII character set, the HTML 4.01 specification (section
        B.2) and IETF RFC 2718 (section 2.2.5) recommend the
        following approach:

     <h3>
      Writing a URI
     </h3>
     <p>
      When written, URIs should be placed inside double quotes
        (e.g., "http://www.kernelnotes.org"), enclosed in angle
        brackets (e.g., &lt;
      <a class="literalurl" href="http://lwn.net" shape="rect" target="_top">
       http://lwn.net
      </a>
      &gt;), or
        placed on a line by themselves. A warning for those who use
        double-quotes:
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        never
       </code>
      </em>
      move extraneous
        punctuation (such as the period ending a sentence or the
        comma in a list) inside a URI, since this will change the
        value of the URI. Instead, use angle brackets instead, or
        switch to a quoting system that never includes extraneous
        characters inside quotation marks. This latter system,
        called the 'new' or 'logical' quoting system by "Hart's
        Rules" and the "Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors",
        is preferred practice in Great Britain and hackers
        worldwide (see the Jargon File's section on Hacker Writing
        Style,
      <a class="literalurl" href="http://www.fwi.uva.nl/~mes/jargon/h/HackerWritingStyle.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       http://www.fwi.uva.nl/~mes/jargon/h/HackerWritingStyle.html
      </a>
      for more information). Older documents suggested inserting
        the prefix "URL:" just before the URI, but this form has
        never caught on.
     </p>
     <p>
      The URI syntax was designed to be unambiguous. However,
        as URIs have become commonplace, traditional media
        (television, radio, newspapers, billboards, etc.) have
        increasingly used abbreviated URI references consisting of
        only the authority and path portions of the identified
        resource (e.g., &lt;www.w3.org/Addressing&gt;). Such
        references are primarily intended for human interpretation
        rather than machine, with the assumption that context-based
        heuristics are sufficient to complete the URI (e.g.,
        hostnames beginning with "www" are likely to have a URI
        prefix of "http://" and hostnames beginning with "ftp"
        likely to have a prefix of "ftp://"). Many client
        implementations heuristically resolve these references.
        Such heuristics may change over time, particularly when new
        schemes are introduced. Since an abbreviated URI has the
        same syntax as a relative URL path, abbreviated URI
        references cannot be used where relative URIs are
        permitted, and can be used only when there is no defined
        base (such as in dialog boxes). Don't use abbreviated URIs
        as hypertext links inside a document; use the standard
        format as described here.

     NOTES
    </h2>
    <p>
     Any tool accepting URIs (e.g., a web browser) on a Linux
      system should be able to handle (directly or indirectly) all
      of the schemes described here, including the man: and info:
      schemes. Handling them by invoking some other program is fine
      and in fact encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
     Technically the fragment isn't part of the URI.
    </p>
    <p>
     For information on how to embed URIs (including URLs) in a
      data format, see documentation on that format. HTML uses the
      format &lt;A HREF="
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       uri
      </code>
     </em>
     "&gt;
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       text
      </code>
     </em>
     &lt;/A&gt;. Texinfo
      files use the format @uref{
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       uri
      </code>
     </em>
     }. Man and mdoc have the
      recently added UR macro, or just include the URI in the text
      (viewers should be able to detect :// as part of a URI).
    </p>
    <p>
     The GNOME and KDE desktop environments currently vary in
      the URIs they accept, in particular in their respective help
      browsers. To list man pages, GNOME uses &lt;toc:man&gt; while
      KDE uses &lt;man:(index)&gt;, and to list info pages, GNOME
      uses &lt;toc:info&gt; while KDE uses &lt;info:(dir)&gt; (the
      author of this man page prefers the KDE approach here, though
      a more regular format would be even better). In general, KDE
      uses &lt;file:/cgi-bin/&gt; as a prefix to a set of generated
      files. KDE prefers documentation in HTML, accessed via the
      &lt;file:/cgi-bin/helpindex&gt;. GNOME prefers the ghelp
      scheme to store and find documentation. Neither browser
      handles file: references to directories at the time of this
      writing, making it difficult to refer to an entire directory
      with a browsable URI. As noted above, these environments
      differ in how they handle the info: scheme, probably the most
      important variation. It is expected that GNOME and KDE will
      converge to common URI formats, and a future version of this
      man page will describe the converged result. Efforts to aid
      this convergence are encouraged.

     <h3>
      Security
     </h3>
     <p>
      A URI does not in itself pose a security threat. There
        is no general guarantee that a URL, which at one time
        located a given resource, will continue to do so. Nor is
        there any guarantee that a URL will not locate a different
        resource at some later point in time; such a guarantee can
        be obtained only from the person(s) controlling that
        namespace and the resource in question.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is sometimes possible to construct a URL such that an
        attempt to perform a seemingly harmless operation, such as
        the retrieval of an entity associated with the resource,
        will in fact cause a possibly damaging remote operation to
        occur. The unsafe URL is typically constructed by
        specifying a port number other than that reserved for the
        network protocol in question. The client unwittingly
        contacts a site that is in fact running a different
        protocol. The content of the URL contains instructions
        that, when interpreted according to this other protocol,
        cause an unexpected operation. An example has been the use
        of a gopher URL to cause an unintended or impersonating
        message to be sent via a SMTP server.
     </p>
     <p>
      Caution should be used when using any URL that specifies
        a port number other than the default for the protocol,
        especially when it is a number within the reserved
        space.
     </p>
     <p>
      Care should be taken when a URI contains escaped
        delimiters for a given protocol (for example, CR and LF
        characters for telnet protocols) that these are not
        unescaped before transmission. This might violate the
        protocol, but avoids the potential for such characters to
        be used to simulate an extra operation or parameter in that
        protocol, which might lead to an unexpected and possibly
        harmful remote operation to be performed.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is clearly unwise to use a URI that contains a
        password which is intended to be secret. In particular, the
        use of a password within the "userinfo" component of a URI
        is strongly recommended against except in those rare cases
        where the "password" parameter is intended to be
        public.

    <h2>
     BUGS
    </h2>
    <p>
     Documentation may be placed in a variety of locations, so
      there currently isn't a good URI scheme for general online
      documentation in arbitrary formats. References of the form
      &lt;file:///usr/doc/ZZZ&gt; don't work because different
      distributions and local installation requirements may place
      the files in different directories (it may be in /usr/doc, or
      /usr/local/doc, or /usr/share, or somewhere else). Also, the
      directory ZZZ usually changes when a version changes (though
      filename globbing could partially overcome this). Finally,
      using the file: scheme doesn't easily support people who
      dynamically load documentation from the Internet (instead of
      loading the files onto a local filesystem). A future URI
      scheme may be added (e.g., "userdoc:") to permit programs to
      include cross-references to more detailed documentation
      without having to know the exact location of that
      documentation. Alternatively, a future version of the
      filesystem specification may specify file locations
      sufficiently so that the file: scheme will be able to locate
      documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many programs and file formats don't include a way to
      incorporate or implement links using URIs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many programs can't handle all of these different URI
      formats; there should be a standard mechanism to load an
      arbitrary URI that automatically detects the users'
      environment (e.g., text or graphics, desktop environment,
      local user preferences, and currently executing tools) and
      invokes the right tool for any URI.
