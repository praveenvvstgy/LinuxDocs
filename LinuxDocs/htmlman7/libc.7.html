     DESCRIPTION
    </h2>
    <p>
     The term "libc" is commonly used as a shorthand for the
      "standard C library", a library of standard functions that
      can be used by all C programs (and sometimes by programs in
      other languages). Because of some history (see below), use of
      the term "libc" to refer to the standard C library is
      somewhat ambiguous on Linux.

     <h3>
      glibc
     </h3>
     <p>
      By far the most widely used C library on Linux is the
        GNU C Library
      <a class="literalurl" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/" shape="rect" target="_top">
       http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/
      </a>
      often referred
        to as
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        glibc
       </code>
      </em>
      . This
        is the C library that is nowadays used in all major Linux
        distributions. It is also the C library whose details are
        documented in the relevant pages of the
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        man-pages
       </code>
      </em>
      project
        (primarily in Section 3 of the manual). Documentation of
        glibc is also available in the glibc manual, available via
        the command
      <span class="emphasis">
       <em>
        info
        libc
       </em>
      </span>
      . Release 1.0 of glibc was made in
        September 1992. (There were earlier 0.x releases.) The next
        major release of glibc was 2.0, at the beginning of
        1997.

     <p>
      The pathname
      <code class="filename">
       /lib/libc.so.6
      </code>
      (or something similar) is
        normally a symbolic link that points to the location of the
        glibc library, and executing this pathname will cause glibc
        to display various information about the version installed
        on your system.

     <h3>
      Linux libc
     </h3>
     <p>
      In the early to mid 1990s, there was for a while
      <span class="emphasis">
       <em>
        Linux libc
       </em>
      </span>
      , a fork
        of glibc 1.x created by Linux developers who felt that
        glibc development at the time was not sufficing for the
        needs of Linux. Often, this library was referred to
        (ambiguously) as just "libc". Linux libc released major
        versions 2, 3, 4, and 5 (as well as many minor versions of
        those releases). For a while, Linux libc was the standard C
        library in many Linux distributions.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, notwithstanding the original motivations of the
        Linux libc effort, by the time glibc 2.0 was released (in
        1997), it was clearly superior to Linux libc, and all major
        Linux distributions that had been using Linux libc soon
        switched back to glibc. Since this switch occurred long
        ago,
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        man-pages
       </code>
      </em>
      no
        longer takes care to document Linux libc details.
        Nevertheless, the history is visible in vestiges of
        information about Linux libc that remain in some manual
        pages, in particular, references to
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        libc4
       </code>
      </em>
      and
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        libc5

      .

     <h3>
      Other C libraries
     </h3>
     <p>
      There are various other less widely used C libraries for
        Linux. These libraries are generally smaller than glibc,
        both in terms of features and memory footprint, and often
        intended for building small binaries, perhaps targeted at
        development for embedded Linux systems. Among such
        libraries are
