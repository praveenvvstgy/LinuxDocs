     DESCRIPTION
    </h2>
    <p>
     The boot sequence varies in details among systems but can
      be roughly divided to the following steps: (i) hardware boot,
      (ii) operating system (OS) loader, (iii) kernel startup, (iv)
      init and inittab, (v) boot scripts. We will describe each of
      these in more detail below.

     <h3>
      Hardware-boot
     </h3>
     <p>
      After power-on or hard reset, control is given to a
        program stored on read-only memory (normally PROM). In PC
        we usually call this program the
      <code class="constant">
       BIOS
      </code>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      This program normally makes a basic self-test of the
        machine and accesses nonvolatile memory to read further
        parameters. This memory in the PC is battery-backed CMOS
        memory, so most people refer to it as the
      <code class="constant">
       CMOS
      </code>
      , although outside of the PC world,
        it is usually called
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        nvram
       </code>
      </em>
      (nonvolatile
        ram).
     </p>
     <p>
      The parameters stored in the nvram vary between systems,
        but as a minimum, the hardware boot program should know
        what is the boot device, or which devices to probe as
        possible boot devices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Then the hardware boot stage accesses the boot device,
        loads the OS loader, which is located on a fixed position
        on the boot device, and transfers control to it.

     <h3>
      OS loader
     </h3>
     <p>
      In PC, the OS loader is located in the first sector of
        the boot device &minus; this is the
      <code class="constant">
       MBR
      </code>
      (Master Boot Record).
     </p>
     <p>
      In most systems, this primary loader is very limited due
        to various constraints. Even on non-PC systems there are
        some limitations to the size and complexity of this loader,
        but the size limitation of the PC MBR (512 bytes including
        the partition table) makes it almost impossible to squeeze
        a full OS loader into it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Therefore, most operating systems make the primary
        loader call a secondary OS loader which may be located on a
        specified disk partition.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Linux the OS loader is normally
      <span class="citerefentry">
       <span class="refentrytitle">
        lilo
       </span>
       (8)
      </span>
      or
      <span class="citerefentry">
       <span class="refentrytitle">
        grub
       </span>
       (8)
      </span>
      . Both of them may
        install either as secondary loaders (where the DOS
        installed MBR points to them), or as a two part loader
        where they provide special MBR containing the bootstrap
        code to load the second part of the loader from the root
        partition.
     </p>
     <p>
      The main job of the OS loader is to locate the kernel on
        the disk, load it and run it. Most OS loaders allow
        interactive use, to enable specification of alternative
        kernel (maybe a backup in case the last compiled one isn't
        functioning) and to pass optional parameters to the
        kernel.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect2">
     <a id="boot-7_sect4" name="boot-7_sect4" shape="rect">
     </a>
     <h3>
      Kernel startup
     </h3>
     <p>
      When the kernel is loaded, it initializes the devices
        (via their drivers), starts the swapper (it is a "kernel
        process", called kswapd in modern Linux kernels), and
        mounts the root filesystem (/).
     </p>
     <p>
      Some of the parameters that may be passed to the kernel
        relate to these activities (e.g: You can override the
        default root filesystem). For further information on Linux
        kernel parameters read
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman7/bootparam.7.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">
        <span class="refentrytitle">
         bootparam
        </span>
        (7)
       </span>
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Only then the kernel creates the first (user land)
        process which is numbered 1. This process executes the
        program
      <code class="filename">
       /sbin/init
      </code>
      , passing
        any parameters that weren't handled by the kernel
        already.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect2">
     <a id="boot-7_sect5" name="boot-7_sect5" shape="rect">
     </a>
     <h3>
      init and inittab
     </h3>
     <p>
      When init starts it reads
      <code class="filename">
       /etc/inittab
      </code>
      for further instructions.
        This file defines what should be run in different
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        run-levels
       </code>
      </em>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      This gives the system administrator an easy management
        scheme, where each run-level is associated with a set of
        services (e.g,
      <code class="constant">
       S
      </code>
      is
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        single-user
       </code>
      </em>
      , on
      <code class="constant">
       2
      </code>
      most network services
        start). The administrator may change the current run-level
        via
      <span class="citerefentry">
       <span class="refentrytitle">
        init
       </span>
       (8)
      </span>
      and query the current
        run-level via
      <span class="citerefentry">
       <span class="refentrytitle">
        runlevel
       </span>
       (8)
      </span>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      However, since it is not convenient to manage individual
        services by editing this file, inittab only bootstraps a
        set of scripts that actually start/stop the individual
        services.

          The following description applies to System V
                release 4-based systems, which currently covers
                most commercial UNIX systems (Solaris, HP-UX, Irix,
                Tru64) as well as the major Linux distributions
                (Red Hat, Debian, Mandriva, SUSE, Ubuntu). Some
                systems (Slackware Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD) have a
                somewhat different scheme of boot scripts.

      </table>
     </div>
     <p>
      For each managed service (mail, nfs server, cron, etc.)
        there is a single startup script located in a specific
        directory (
      <code class="filename">
       /etc/init.d
      </code>
      in
        most versions of Linux). Each of these scripts accepts as a
        single argument the word "start" &minus;&minus; causing it
        to start the service, or the word "stop" &minus;&minus;
        causing it to stop the service. The script may optionally
        accept other "convenience" parameters (e.g: "restart", to
        stop and then start, "status" to display the service
        status). Running the script without parameters displays the
        possible arguments.

     <h3>
      Sequencing directories
     </h3>
     <p>
      To make specific scripts start/stop at specific
        run-levels and in specific order, there are
      <span class="emphasis">
       <em>
        sequencing directories
       </em>
      </span>
      . These
        are normally in
      <code class="filename">
       /etc/rc[0&minus;6S].d
      </code>
      . In each of these
        directories there are links (usually symbolic) to the
        scripts in the
      <code class="filename">
       /etc/init.d
      </code>
      directory.
     </p>
     <p>
      A primary script (usually
      <code class="filename">
       /etc/rc
      </code>
      ) is called from
      <span class="citerefentry">
       <span class="refentrytitle">
        inittab
       </span>
       (5)
      </span>
      and calls the
        services scripts via the links in the sequencing
        directories. All links with names that begin with 'S' are
        being called with the argument "start" (thereby starting
        the service). All links with names that begin with 'K' are
        being called with the argument "stop" (thereby stopping the
        service).
     </p>
     <p>
      To define the starting or stopping order within the same
        run-level, the names of the links contain order-numbers.
        Also, to make the names clearer, they usually end with the
        name of the service they refer to. Example: the link
      <code class="filename">
       /etc/rc2.d/S80sendmail
      </code>
      starts
        the sendmail service on runlevel 2. This happens after
      <code class="filename">
       /etc/rc2.d/S12syslog
      </code>
      is run
        but before
      <code class="filename">
       /etc/rc2.d/S90xfs
      </code>
      is run.
     </p>
     <p>
      To manage the boot order and run-levels, we have to
        manage these links. However, on many versions of Linux,
        there are tools to help with this task (e.g:
      <span class="citerefentry">
       <span class="refentrytitle">
        chkconfig
       </span>
       (8)
      </span>
      ).
     </p>

     </a>
     <h3>
      Boot configuration
     </h3>
     <p>
      Usually the daemons started may optionally receive
        command-line options and parameters. To allow system
        administrators to change these parameters without editing
        the boot scripts themselves, configuration files are used.
        These are located in a specific directory (
      <code class="filename">
       /etc/sysconfig
      </code>
      on Red Hat systems) and
        are used by the boot scripts.
     </p>
     <p>
      In older UNIX systems, these files contained the actual
        command line options for the daemons, but in modern Linux
        systems (and also in HP-UX), these files just contain shell
        variables. The boot scripts in
      <code class="filename">
       /etc/init.d
      </code>
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>

        files, and then use the variable values.
