     DESCRIPTION
    </h2>
    <p>
     The international standard ISO 10646 defines the Universal
      Character Set (UCS). UCS contains all characters of all other
      character set standards. It also guarantees "round-trip
      compatibility"; in other words, conversion tables can be
      built such that no information is lost when a string is
      converted from any other encoding to UCS and back.
    </p>
    <p>
     UCS contains the characters required to represent
      practically all known languages. This includes not only the
      Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic, Armenian, and
      Georgian scripts, but also Chinese, Japanese and Korean Han
      ideographs as well as scripts such as Hiragana, Katakana,
      Hangul, Devanagari, Bengali, Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Oriya,
      Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Thai, Lao, Khmer,
      Bopomofo, Tibetan, Runic, Ethiopic, Canadian Syllabics,
      Cherokee, Mongolian, Ogham, Myanmar, Sinhala, Thaana, Yi, and
      others. For scripts not yet covered, research on how to best
      encode them for computer usage is still going on and they
      will be added eventually. This might eventually include not
      only Hieroglyphs and various historic Indo-European
      languages, but even some selected artistic scripts such as
      Tengwar, Cirth, and Klingon. UCS also covers a large number
      of graphical, typographical, mathematical, and scientific
      symbols, including those provided by TeX, Postscript, APL,
      MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Macintosh, OCR fonts, as well as many
      word processing and publishing systems, and more are being
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
     The UCS standard (ISO 10646) describes a 31-bit character
      set architecture consisting of 128 24-bit
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       groups
      </code>
     </em>
     , each divided into 256
      16-bit
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       planes
      </code>
     </em>
     made
      up of 256 8-bit
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       rows
      </code>
     </em>
     with 256
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       column
      </code>
     </em>
     positions, one for
      each character. Part 1 of the standard (ISO 10646-1) defines
      the first 65534 code positions (0x0000 to 0xfffd), which form
      the
     <span class="emphasis">
      <em>
       Basic Multilingual
      Plane
      </em>
     </span>
     (BMP), that is plane 0 in group 0. Part 2
      of the standard (ISO 10646-2) adds characters to group 0
      outside the BMP in several
     <span class="emphasis">
      <em>
       supplementary planes
      </em>
     </span>
     in the range
      0x10000 to 0x10ffff. There are no plans to add characters
      beyond 0x10ffff to the standard, therefore of the entire code
      space, only a small fraction of group 0 will ever be actually
      used in the foreseeable future. The BMP contains all
      characters found in the commonly used other character sets.
      The supplemental planes added by ISO 10646-2 cover only more
      exotic characters for special scientific, dictionary
      printing, publishing industry, higher-level protocol and
      enthusiast needs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The representation of each UCS character as a 2-byte word
      is referred to as the UCS-2 form (only for BMP characters),
      whereas UCS-4 is the representation of each character by a
      4-byte word. In addition, there exist two encoding forms
      UTF-8 for backward compatibility with ASCII processing
      software and UTF-16 for the backward-compatible handling of
      non-BMP characters up to 0x10ffff by UCS-2 software.
    </p>
    <p>
     The UCS characters 0x0000 to 0x007f are identical to those
      of the classic US-ASCII character set and the characters in
      the range 0x0000 to 0x00ff are identical to those in ISO
      8859-1 (Latin-1).

     <h3>
      Combining characters
     </h3>
     <p>
      Some code points in UCS have been assigned to
      <span class="emphasis">
       <em>
        combining
        characters
       </em>
      </span>
      . These are similar to the nonspacing
        accent keys on a typewriter. A combining character just
        adds an accent to the previous character. The most
        important accented characters have codes of their own in
        UCS, however, the combining character mechanism allows us
        to add accents and other diacritical marks to any
        character. The combining characters always follow the
        character which they modify. For example, the German
        character Umlaut-A ("Latin capital letter A with
        diaeresis") can either be represented by the precomposed
        UCS code 0x00c4, or alternatively as the combination of a
        normal "Latin capital letter A" followed by a "combining
        diaeresis": 0x0041 0x0308.
     </p>
     <p>
      Combining characters are essential for instance for
        encoding the Thai script or for mathematical typesetting
        and users of the International Phonetic Alphabet.

     <h3>
      Implementation levels
     </h3>
     <p>
      As not all systems are expected to support advanced
        mechanisms like combining characters, ISO 10646-1 specifies
        the following three
      <span class="emphasis">
       <em>
        implementation levels
       </em>
      </span>
      of
        UCS:
     </p>
     <div class="variablelist">
      <dl class="variablelist">
       <dt>
        <span class="term">

        </span>
       </dt>
       <dd>
        <p>
         Combining characters and Hangul Jamo (a variant
              encoding of the Korean script, where a Hangul
              syllable glyph is coded as a triplet or pair of
              vovel/consonant codes) are not supported.
        </p>
       </dd>

         Level 2
        </span>
       </dt>
       <dd>
        <p>
         In addition to level 1, combining characters are
              now allowed for some languages where they are
              essential (e.g., Thai, Lao, Hebrew, Arabic,
              Devanagari, Malayalam).

       <dd>
        <p>
         All UCS characters are supported.

      The Unicode 3.0 Standard published by the Unicode
        Consortium contains exactly the UCS Basic Multilingual
        Plane at implementation level 3, as described in ISO
        10646-1:2000. Unicode 3.1 added the supplemental planes of
        ISO 10646-2. The Unicode standard and technical reports
        published by the Unicode Consortium provide much additional
        information on the semantics and recommended usages of
        various characters. They provide guidelines and algorithms
        for editing, sorting, comparing, normalizing, converting,
        and displaying Unicode strings.

        integer type. Its values are always interpreted by the C
        library as UCS code values (in all locales), a convention
        that is signaled by the GNU C library to applications by
        defining the constant

      UCS/Unicode can be used just like ASCII in input/output
        streams, terminal communication, plaintext files,

      In the Basic Multilingual Plane, the range 0xe000 to

        individually by any end-user and the Linux zone in the
        range 0xf000 to 0xf8ff where extensions are coordinated
        among all Linux users. The registry of the characters
