     DESCRIPTION
    </h2>
    <p>
     Regular expressions ("RE"s), as defined in POSIX.2, come
      in two forms: modern REs (roughly those of
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       egrep
      </code>
     </em>
     ; POSIX.2 calls these
      "extended" REs) and obsolete REs (roughly those of
     <span class="citerefentry">
      <span class="refentrytitle">
       ed
      </span>
      (1)
     </span>
     ; POSIX.2 "basic" REs).
      Obsolete REs mostly exist for backward compatibility in some
      old programs; they will be discussed at the end. POSIX.2
      leaves some aspects of RE syntax and semantics open;
      "&Dagger;" marks decisions on these aspects that may not be
      fully portable to other POSIX.2 implementations.
    </p>
    <p>
     A (modern) RE is one&Dagger; or more nonempty&Dagger;
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       branches
      </code>
     </em>
     , separated
      by '|'. It matches anything that matches one of the
      branches.
    </p>
    <p>
     A branch is one&Dagger; or more
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       pieces
      </code>
     </em>
     , concatenated. It
      matches a match for the first, followed by a match for the
      second, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
     A piece is an
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       atom
      </code>
     </em>
     possibly followed by a
      single&Dagger; '*', '+', '?', or
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       bound
      </code>
     </em>
     . An atom followed by
      '*' matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom. An
      atom followed by '+' matches a sequence of 1 or more matches
      of the atom. An atom followed by '?' matches a sequence of 0
      or 1 matches of the atom.
    </p>
    <p>
     A
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       bound
      </code>
     </em>
     is '{'
      followed by an unsigned decimal integer, possibly followed by
      ',' possibly followed by another unsigned decimal integer,
      always followed by '}'. The integers must lie between 0 and
     <code class="constant">
      RE_DUP_MAX
     </code>
     (255&Dagger;)
      inclusive, and if there are two of them, the first may not
      exceed the second. An atom followed by a bound containing one
      integer
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       i
      </code>
     </em>
     and no
      comma matches a sequence of exactly
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       i
      </code>
     </em>
     matches of the atom. An
      atom followed by a bound containing one integer
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       i
      </code>
     </em>
     and a comma matches a
      sequence of
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       i
      </code>
     </em>
     or
      more matches of the atom. An atom followed by a bound
      containing two integers
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       i
      </code>
     </em>
     and
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       j
      </code>
     </em>
     matches a sequence of
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       i
      </code>
     </em>
     through
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       j
      </code>
     </em>
     (inclusive)
      matches of the atom.
    </p>
    <p>
     An atom is a regular expression enclosed in "()" (matching
      a match for the regular expression), an empty set of "()"
      (matching the null string)&Dagger;, a
     <span class="emphasis">
      <em>
       bracket expression
      </em>
     </span>
     (see below),
      '.' (matching any single character), '^' (matching the null
      string at the beginning of a line), '$' (matching the null
      string at the end of a line), a '\' followed by one of the
      characters "
     <code class="function">
      ^.[$
     </code>
     ()|*+?{\"
      (matching that character taken as an ordinary character), a
      '\' followed by any other character&Dagger; (matching that
      character taken as an ordinary character, as if the '\' had
      not been present&Dagger;), or a single character with no
      other significance (matching that character). A '{' followed
      by a character other than a digit is an ordinary character,
      not the beginning of a bound&Dagger;. It is illegal to end an
      RE with '\'.
    </p>
    <p>
     A
     <span class="emphasis">
      <em>
       bracket
      expression
      </em>
     </span>
     is a list of characters enclosed in
      "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       []
      </code>
     </em>
     ". It normally
      matches any single character from the list (but see below).
      If the list begins with '^', it matches any single character
      (but see below)
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       not
      </code>
     </em>
     from the rest of the list. If two characters in the list are
      separated by '&minus;', this is shorthand for the full
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       range
      </code>
     </em>
     of characters
      between those two (inclusive) in the collating sequence, for
      example, "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       [0&minus;9]
      </code>
     </em>
     " in ASCII matches
      any decimal digit. It is illegal&Dagger; for two ranges to
      share an endpoint, for example, "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       a-c-e
      </code>
     </em>
     ". Ranges are very
      collating-sequence-dependent, and portable programs should
      avoid relying on them.
    </p>
    <p>
     To include a literal ']' in the list, make it the first
      character (following a possible '^'). To include a literal
      '&minus;', make it the first or last character, or the second
      endpoint of a range. To use a literal '&minus;' as the first
      endpoint of a range, enclose it in "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       [.
      </code>
     </em>
     " and "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       .]
      </code>
     </em>
     " to make it a collating
      element (see below). With the exception of these and some
      combinations using '[' (see next paragraphs), all other
      special characters, including '\', lose their special
      significance within a bracket expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     Within a bracket expression, a collating element (a
      character, a multicharacter sequence that collates as if it
      were a single character, or a collating-sequence name for
      either) enclosed in "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       [.
      </code>
     </em>
     " and "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       .]
      </code>
     </em>
     " stands for the sequence
      of characters of that collating element. The sequence is a
      single element of the bracket expression's list. A bracket
      expression containing a multicharacter collating element can
      thus match more than one character, for example, if the
      collating sequence includes a "ch" collating element, then
      the RE "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       [[.ch.]]*c
      </code>
     </em>
     "
      matches the first five characters of "chchcc".
    </p>
    <p>
     Within a bracket expression, a collating element enclosed
      in "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       [=
      </code>
     </em>
     " and
      "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       =]
      </code>
     </em>
     " is an
      equivalence class, standing for the sequences of characters
      of all collating elements equivalent to that one, including
      itself. (If there are no other equivalent collating elements,
      the treatment is as if the enclosing delimiters were
      "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       [.
      </code>
     </em>
     " and
      "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       .]
      </code>
     </em>
     ".) For example,
      if o and ^ are the members of an equivalence class, then
      "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       [[=o=]]
      </code>

      "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       [o^]
      </code>
     </em>
     " are all
      synonymous. An equivalence class may not&Dagger; be an
      endpoint of a range.

     These stand for the character classes defined in

      <span class="citerefentry">
       <span class="refentrytitle">
        wctype
       </span>
       (3)
      </span>
     </a>
     . A locale may
      provide others. A character class may not be used as an
      endpoint of a range.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the event that an RE could match more than one
      substring of a given string, the RE matches the one starting
      earliest in the string. If the RE could match more than one
      substring starting at that point, it matches the longest.
      Subexpressions also match the longest possible substrings,
      subject to the constraint that the whole match be as long as
      possible, with subexpressions starting earlier in the RE
      taking priority over ones starting later. Note that
      higher-level subexpressions thus take priority over their
      lower-level component subexpressions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Match lengths are measured in characters, not collating
      elements. A null string is considered longer than no match at
      all. For example, "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       bb*
      </code>
     </em>
     " matches the three middle
      characters of "abbbc", "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       (wee|week)(knights|nights)
      </code>
     </em>
     "
      matches all ten characters of "weeknights", when "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       (.*).*
      </code>
     </em>
     " is matched against
      "abc" the parenthesized subexpression matches all three
      characters, and when "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       (a*)*
      </code>
     </em>
     " is matched against
      "bc" both the whole RE and the parenthesized subexpression
      match the null string.
    </p>
    <p>
     If case-independent matching is specified, the effect is
      much as if all case distinctions had vanished from the
      alphabet. When an alphabetic that exists in multiple cases
      appears as an ordinary character outside a bracket
      expression, it is effectively transformed into a bracket
      expression containing both cases, for example, 'x' becomes
      "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       [xX]
      </code>
     </em>
     ". When it
      appears inside a bracket expression, all case counterparts of
      it are added to the bracket expression, so that, for example,
      "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       [x]
      </code>
     </em>
     " becomes
      "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       [xX]
      </code>
     </em>
     " and
      "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       [^x]
      </code>
     </em>
     " becomes
      "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       [^xX]
      </code>
     </em>
     ".
    </p>
    <p>
     No particular limit is imposed on the length of
      REs&Dagger;. Programs intended to be portable should not
      employ REs longer than 256 bytes, as an implementation can
      refuse to accept such REs and remain POSIX-compliant.
    </p>
    <p>
     Obsolete ("basic") regular expressions differ in several
      respects. '|', '+', and '?' are ordinary characters and there
      is no equivalent for their functionality. The delimiters for
      bounds are "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       \{
      </code>
     </em>
     " and
      "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       \}
      </code>
     </em>
     ", with '{' and
      '}' by themselves ordinary characters. The parentheses for
      nested subexpressions are "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       \(
      </code>
     </em>
     " and "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       \)
      </code>
     </em>
     ", with '(' and ')' by
      themselves ordinary characters. '^' is an ordinary character
      except at the beginning of the RE or&Dagger; the beginning of
      a parenthesized subexpression, '$' is an ordinary character
      except at the end of the RE or&Dagger; the end of a
      parenthesized subexpression, and '*' is an ordinary character
      if it appears at the beginning of the RE or the beginning of
      a parenthesized subexpression (after a possible leading
      '^').
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, there is one new type of atom, a
     <span class="emphasis">
      <em>
       back reference
      </em>
     </span>
     : '\' followed by a
      nonzero decimal digit
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>

     matches the same sequence

     </em>
     th parenthesized
      subexpression (numbering subexpressions by the positions of
      their opening parentheses, left to right), so that, for
      example, "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       \([bc]\)\1

     BUGS
    </h2>
    <p>
     Having two kinds of REs is a botch.
    </p>
    <p>
     The current POSIX.2 spec says that ')' is an ordinary
      character in the absence of an unmatched '('; this was an
      unintentional result of a wording error, and change is
      likely. Avoid relying on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back references are a dreadful botch, posing major
      problems for efficient implementations. They are also
      somewhat vaguely defined (does "
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       a\(\(b\)*\2\)*d
      </code>
     </em>
     " match
      "abbbd"?). Avoid using them.
    </p>
    <p>
     POSIX.2's specification of case-independent matching is
      vague. The "one case implies all cases" definition given
      above is current consensus among implementors as to the right
      interpretation.
