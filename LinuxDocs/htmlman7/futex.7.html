     DESCRIPTION
    </h2>
    <p>
     The Linux kernel provides futexes ("Fast user-space
      mutexes") as a building block for fast user-space locking and
      semaphores. Futexes are very basic and lend themselves well
      for building higher level locking abstractions such as POSIX
      mutexes.
    </p>
    <p>
     This page does not set out to document all design
      decisions but restricts itself to issues relevant for
      application and library development. Most programmers will in
      fact not be using futexes directly but instead rely on system
      libraries built on them, such as the NPTL pthreads
      implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
     A futex is identified by a piece of memory which can be
      shared between different processes. In these different
      processes, it need not have identical addresses. In its bare
      form, a futex has semaphore semantics; it is a counter that
      can be incremented and decremented atomically; processes can
      wait for the value to become positive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Futex operation is entirely user space for the
      noncontended case. The kernel is involved only to arbitrate
      the contended case. As any sane design will strive for
      noncontention, futexes are also optimized for this
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     In its bare form, a futex is an aligned integer which is
      touched only by atomic assembler instructions. Processes can
      share this integer using
     <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/mmap.2.html" shape="rect" target="_top">

       <span class="refentrytitle">

       </span>

      </span>
     </a>
     , via shared memory
      segments or because they share memory space, in which case
      the application is commonly called multithreaded.
    </p>

     <h3>
      Semantics
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any futex operation starts in user space, but it may be
        necessary to communicate with the kernel using the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/futex.2.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">
        <span class="refentrytitle">
         futex
        </span>
        (2)
       </span>
      </a>
      system call.
     </p>
     <p>
      To "up" a futex, execute the proper assembler
        instructions that will cause the host CPU to atomically
        increment the integer. Afterward, check if it has in fact
        changed from 0 to 1, in which case there were no waiters
        and the operation is done. This is the noncontended case
        which is fast and should be common.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the contended case, the atomic increment changed the
        counter from &minus;1 (or some other negative number). If
        this is detected, there are waiters. User space should now
        set the counter to 1 and instruct the kernel to wake up any
        waiters using the
      <code class="constant">
       FUTEX_WAKE
      </code>
      operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Waiting on a futex, to "down" it, is the reverse
        operation. Atomically decrement the counter and check if it
        changed to 0, in which case the operation is done and the
        futex was uncontended. In all other circumstances, the
        process should set the counter to &minus;1 and request that
        the kernel wait for another process to up the futex. This
        is done using the
      <code class="constant">
       FUTEX_WAIT
      </code>
      operation.
     </p>

      </a>
      system call can
        optionally be passed a timeout specifying how long the
        kernel should wait for the futex to be upped. In this case,
        semantics are more complex and the programmer is referred
        to

      for more
        details. The same holds for asynchronous futex waiting.

     VERSIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
     Initial futex support was merged in Linux 2.5.7 but with
      different semantics from those described above. Current
      semantics are available from Linux 2.5.40 onward.

    <h2>
     NOTES
    </h2>
    <p>
     To reiterate, bare futexes are not intended as an easy to
      use abstraction for end-users. Implementors are expected to
      be assembly literate and to have read the sources of the
      futex user-space library referenced below.
