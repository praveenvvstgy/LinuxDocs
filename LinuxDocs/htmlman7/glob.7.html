     DESCRIPTION
    </h2>
    <p>
     Long ago, in UNIX V6, there was a program
     <code class="filename">
      /etc/glob
     </code>
     that would expand wildcard
      patterns. Soon afterward this became a shell built-in.
    </p>
    <p>
     These days there is also a library routine
     <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/glob.3.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
      <span class="citerefentry">
       <span class="refentrytitle">
        glob
       </span>
       (3)
      </span>
     </a>
     that will perform
      this function for a user program.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rules are as follows (POSIX.2, 3.13).

     <h3>
      Wildcard matching
     </h3>
     <p>
      A string is a wildcard pattern if it contains one of the
        characters '?', '*' or '['. Globbing is the operation that
        expands a wildcard pattern into the list of pathnames
        matching the pattern. Matching is defined by:
     </p>
     <p>
      A '?' (not between brackets) matches any single
        character.
     </p>
     <p>
      A '*' (not between brackets) matches any string,
        including the empty string.
     </p>
     <p>

       </em>
      </span>
     </p>
     <p>
      An expression "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        [...]
       </code>
      </em>
      " where the first
        character after the leading '[' is not an '!' matches a
        single character, namely any of the characters enclosed by
        the brackets. The string enclosed by the brackets cannot be
        empty; therefore ']' can be allowed between the brackets,
        provided that it is the first character. (Thus, "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        [][!]
       </code>
      </em>
      " matches the three
        characters '[', ']' and '!'.)
     </p>
     <p>
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        Ranges
       </code>
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      There is one special convention: two characters
        separated by '&minus;' denote a range. (Thus, "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        [A&minus;Fa&minus;f0&minus;9]
       </code>
      </em>
      "
        is equivalent to "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        [ABCDEFabcdef0123456789]
       </code>
      </em>
      ".)
        One may include '&minus;' in its literal meaning by making
        it the first or last character between the brackets. (Thus,
        "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        []&minus;]
       </code>
      </em>
      "
        matches just the two characters ']' and '&minus;', and
        "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        [&minus;&minus;0]
       </code>
      </em>
      " matches
        the three characters '&minus;', '.', '0', since '/' cannot
        be matched.)
     </p>
     <p>
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        Complementation
       </code>
      </em>
     </p>
     <p>
      An expression "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        [!...]
       </code>
      </em>
      " matches a single
        character, namely any character that is not matched by the
        expression obtained by removing the first '!' from it.
        (Thus, "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        [!]a&minus;]
       </code>
      </em>
      " matches any
        single character except ']', 'a' and '&minus;'.)
     </p>
     <p>
      One can remove the special meaning of '?', '*' and '['
        by preceding them by a backslash, or, in case this is part
        of a shell command line, enclosing them in quotes. Between
        brackets these characters stand for themselves. Thus,
        "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        [[?*\]
       </code>
      </em>
      " matches
        the four characters '[', '?', '*' and '\'.

     <h3>
      Pathnames
     </h3>
     <p>
      Globbing is applied on each of the components of a
        pathname separately. A '/' in a pathname cannot be matched
        by a '?' or '*' wildcard, or by a range like "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        [.&minus;0]
       </code>
      </em>
      ". A range
        cannot contain an explicit '/' character; this would lead
        to a syntax error.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a filename starts with a '.', this character must be
        matched explicitly. (Thus,
      <span class="emphasis">
       <em>
        rm
        *
       </em>
      </span>

      <span class="emphasis">
       <em>
        tar c *
       </em>
      </span>
      will not archive all
        your files;
      <span class="emphasis">
       <em>
        tar c .
       </em>
      </span>
      is better.)

     <h3>
      Empty lists
     </h3>
     <p>
      The nice and simple rule given above: "expand a wildcard
        pattern into the list of matching pathnames" was the
        original UNIX definition. It allowed one to have patterns
        that expand into an empty list, as in
     </p>
     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
    xv &minus;wait 0 *.gif *.jpg
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      where perhaps no *.gif files are present (and this is
        not an error). However, POSIX requires that a wildcard
        pattern is left unchanged when it is syntactically
        incorrect, or the list of matching pathnames is empty. With
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        bash
       </code>
      </em>
      one can
        force the classical behavior using this command:
     </p>
     <p>
      shopt &minus;s nullglob
     </p>
     <p>
      (Similar problems occur elsewhere. For example, where
        old scripts have
     </p>
     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
    rm `find . &minus;name "*~"`
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      new scripts require
     </p>
     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
    rm &minus;f nosuchfile `find . &minus;name "*~"`
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      to avoid error messages from
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        rm
       </strong>
      </span>
      called with an empty
        argument list.)
     </p>
    </div>
   </div>
   <div class="refsect1">

     <h3>
      Regular expressions
     </h3>
     <p>
      Note that wildcard patterns are not regular expressions,
        although they are a bit similar. First of all, they match
        filenames, rather than text, and secondly, the conventions
        are not the same: for example, in a regular expression '*'
        means zero or more copies of the preceding thing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now that regular expressions have bracket expressions
        where the negation is indicated by a '^', POSIX has
        declared the effect of a wildcard pattern "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        [^...]
       </code>
      </em>
      " to be
        undefined.

      Character classes and internationalization
     </h3>
     <p>
      Of course ranges were originally meant to be ASCII
        ranges, so that "
      <span class="emphasis">
       <em>
        [
        &minus;%]
       </em>
      </span>
      " stands for "
      <span class="emphasis">
       <em>
        [ !"#$%]
       </em>
      </span>
      " and "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        [a&minus;z]
       </code>
      </em>
      " stands for
        "any lowercase letter". Some UNIX implementations
        generalized this so that a range X&minus;Y stands for the
        set of characters with code between the codes for X and for
        Y. However, this requires the user to know the character
        coding in use on the local system, and moreover, is not
        convenient if the collating sequence for the local alphabet
        differs from the ordering of the character codes.
        Therefore, POSIX extended the bracket notation greatly,
        both for wildcard patterns and for regular expressions. In
        the above we saw three types of items that can occur in a
        bracket expression: namely (i) the negation, (ii) explicit
        single characters, and (iii) ranges. POSIX specifies ranges
        in an internationally more useful way and adds three more
        types:
     </p>
     <p>
      (iii) Ranges X&minus;Y comprise all characters that fall
        between X and Y (inclusive) in the current collating
        sequence as defined by the
      <code class="constant">
       LC_COLLATE
      </code>
      category in the current
        locale.
     </p>
     <p>
      (iv) Named character classes, like
     </p>
     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
[:alnum:]  [:alpha:]  [:blank:]  [:cntrl:]
[:digit:]  [:graph:]  [:lower:]  [:print:]
[:punct:]  [:space:]  [:upper:]  [:xdigit:]
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      so that one can say "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        [[:lower:]]
       </code>
      </em>
      " instead of
        "
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        [a&minus;z]
       </code>
      </em>
      ",
        and have things work in Denmark, too, where there are three
        letters past 'z' in the alphabet. These character classes
        are defined by the
      <code class="constant">
       LC_CTYPE
      </code>
      category in the current locale.
     </p>
     <p>
      (v) Collating symbols, like "
