     PCRE DISCUSSION OF STACK USAGE
    </h2>
    <p>
     When you call
     <code class="function">
      pcre[16|32]_exec
     </code>
     (), it makes use of an
      internal function called
     <code class="function">
      match
     </code>
     (). This calls itself recursively at
      branch points in the pattern, in order to remember the state
      of the match so that it can back up and try a different
      alternative if the first one fails. As matching proceeds
      deeper and deeper into the tree of possibilities, the
      recursion depth increases. The
     <code class="function">
      match
     </code>
     () function is also called in other
      circumstances, for example, whenever a parenthesized
      sub-pattern is entered, and in certain cases of
      repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not all calls of
     <code class="function">
      match
     </code>
     ()
      increase the recursion depth; for an item such as a* it may
      be called several times at the same level, after matching
      different numbers of a's. Furthermore, in a number of cases
      where the result of the recursive call would immediately be
      passed back as the result of the current call (a "tail
      recursion"), the function is just restarted instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     The above comments apply when
     <code class="function">
      pcre[16|32]_exec
     </code>
     () is run in its normal
      interpretive manner. If the pattern was studied with the
      PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE option, and just-in-time compiling was
      successful, and the options passed to
     <code class="function">
      pcre[16|32]_exec
     </code>
     () were not incompatible,
      the matching process uses the JIT-compiled code instead of
      the
     <code class="function">
      match
     </code>
     () function. In this
      case, the memory requirements are handled entirely
      differently. See the

    <p>
     The
     <code class="function">
      pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec
     </code>
     ()
      function operates in an entirely different way, and uses
      recursion only when there is a regular expression recursion
      or subroutine call in the pattern. This includes the
      processing of assertion and "once-only" subpatterns, which
      are handled like subroutine calls. Normally, these are never
      very deep, and the limit on the complexity of
     <code class="function">
      pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec
     </code>
     () is controlled by the
      amount of workspace it is given. However, it is possible to
      write patterns with runaway infinite recursions; such
      patterns will cause
     <code class="function">
      pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec
     </code>
     () to run out of stack.
      At present, there is no protection against this.

    <p>
     The comments that follow do NOT apply to
     <code class="function">

      Reducing
      <code class="function">
       pcre[16|32]_exec
      </code>
      ()'s stack usage
     </h3>
     <p>
      Each time that
      <code class="function">
       match
      </code>
      () is
        actually called recursively, it uses memory from the
        process stack. For certain kinds of pattern and data, very
        large amounts of stack may be needed, despite the
        recognition of "tail recursion". You can often reduce the
        amount of recursion, and therefore the amount of stack
        used, by modifying the pattern that is being matched.
        Consider, for example, this pattern:
     </p>
     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
([^&lt;]|&lt;(?!inet))+
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      It matches from wherever it starts until it encounters
        "&lt;inet" or the end of the data, and is the kind of
        pattern that might be used when processing an XML file.
        Each iteration of the outer parentheses matches either one
        character that is not "&lt;" or a "&lt;" that is not
        followed by "inet". However, each time a parenthesis is
        processed, a recursion occurs, so this formulation uses a
        stack frame for each matched character. For a long string,
        a lot of stack is required. Consider now this rewritten
        pattern, which matches exactly the same strings:
     </p>
     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
([^&lt;]++|&lt;(?!inet))+
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      This uses very much less stack, because runs of
        characters that do not contain "&lt;" are "swallowed" in
        one item inside the parentheses. Recursion happens only
        when a "&lt;" character that is not followed by "inet" is
        encountered (and we assume this is relatively rare). A
        possessive quantifier is used to stop any backtracking into
        the runs of non-"&lt;" characters, but that is not related
        to stack usage.
     </p>
     <p>
      This example shows that one way of avoiding stack
        problems when matching long subject strings is to write
        repeated parenthesized subpatterns to match more than one
        character whenever possible.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In environments where stack memory is constrained, you
        might want to compile PCRE to use heap memory instead of
        stack for remembering back-up points when
      <code class="function">
       pcre[16|32]_exec
      </code>
      () is running. This makes
        it run a lot more slowly, however. Details of how to do
        this are given in the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrebuild.3.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">

       </span>
      </a>
      documentation. When built in this way, instead of using the
        stack, PCRE obtains and frees memory by calling the
        functions that are pointed to by the
      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        pcre[16|32]_stack_malloc
       </code>
      </em>

      <em class="replaceable">
       <code>
        pcre[16|32]_stack_free
       </code>
      </em>
      variables. By default, these point to
      <code class="function">
       malloc
      </code>
      () and
      <code class="function">
       free
      </code>
      (), but you can replace the pointers
        to cause PCRE to use your own functions. Since the block
        sizes are always the same, and are always freed in reverse
        order, it may be possible to implement customized memory
        handlers that are more efficient than the standard
        functions.

     <p>
      You can set limits on the number of times that
      <code class="function">
       match

      <code class="function">
       pcre[16|32]_exec
      </code>
      () returns an error code.
        Setting suitable limits should prevent it from running out
        of stack. The default values of the limits are very large,
        and unlikely ever to operate. They can be changed when PCRE
        is built, and they can also be set when
      <code class="function">
       pcre[16|32]_exec

     <p>
      As a very rough rule of thumb, you should reckon on
        about 500 bytes per recursion. Thus, if you want to limit
        your stack usage to 8Mb, you should set the limit at 16000
        recursions. A 64Mb stack, on the other hand, can support
        around 128000 recursions.

       &minus;M
      </code>
      ) can
        be used to find the smallest limits that allow a particular
        pattern to match a given subject string. This is done by
        calling
      <code class="function">

     <h3>
      Obtaining an estimate of stack usage
     </h3>
     <p>
      The actual amount of stack used per recursion can vary
        quite a lot, depending on the compiler that was used to
        build PCRE and the optimization or debugging options that
        were set for it. The rule of thumb value of 500 bytes
        mentioned above may be larger or smaller than what is
        actually needed. A better approximation can be obtained by
        running this command:
     </p>
     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
pcretest -m -C
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      The
      <code class="option">
       &minus;C
      </code>
      option causes
      <span class="command">
       <strong>
        pcretest
       </strong>
      </span>
      to
        output information about the options with which PCRE was
        compiled. When
      <code class="option">
       &minus;m
      </code>
      is also
        given (before
      <code class="option">
       &minus;C
      </code>
      ),
        information about stack use is given in a line like
        this:
     </p>
     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
Match recursion uses stack: approximate frame size = 640 bytes
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      The value is approximate because some recursions need a
        bit more (up to perhaps 16 more bytes).
     </p>
     <p>
      If the above command is given when PCRE is compiled to
        use the heap instead of the stack for recursion, the value
        that is output is the size of each block that is obtained
        from the heap.
     </p>

     </a>
     <h3>
      Changing stack size in Unix-like systems
     </h3>
     <p>
      In Unix-like environments, there is not often a problem
        with the stack unless very long strings are involved,
        though the default limit on stack size varies from system
        to system. Values from 8Mb to 64Mb are common. You can find
        your default limit by running the command:
     </p>
     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
ulimit -s
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      Unfortunately, the effect of running out of stack is
        often SIGSEGV, though sometimes a more explicit error
        message is given. You can normally increase the limit on
        stack size by code such as this:
     </p>
     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 struct rlimit rlim;
 getrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, &amp;rlim);
 rlim.rlim_cur = 100*1024*1024;
 setrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, &amp;rlim);
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      This reads the current limits (soft and hard) using
      <code class="function">
       getrlimit
      </code>
      (), then attempts to
        increase the soft limit to 100Mb using
      <code class="function">
       setrlimit
      </code>
      (). You must do this before
        calling
      <code class="function">
       pcre[16|32]_exec
      </code>
      ().
