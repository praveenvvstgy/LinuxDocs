     PARTIAL MATCHING IN PCRE
    </h2>
    <p>
     In normal use of PCRE, if the subject string that is
      passed to a matching function matches as far as it goes, but
      is too short to match the entire pattern, PCRE_ERROR_NOMATCH
      is returned. There are circumstances where it might be
      helpful to distinguish this case from other cases in which
      there is no match.
    </p>
    <p>
     Consider, for example, an application where a human is
      required to type in data for a field with specific formatting
      requirements. An example might be a date in the form
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       ddmmmyy
      </code>
     </em>
     , defined by
      this pattern:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     If the application sees the user's keystrokes one by one,
      and can check that what has been typed so far is potentially
      valid, it is able to raise an error as soon as a mistake is
      made, by beeping and not reflecting the character that has
      been typed, for example. This immediate feedback is likely to
      be a better user interface than a check that is delayed until
      the entire string has been entered. Partial matching can also
      be useful when the subject string is very long and is not all
      available at once.
    </p>
    <p>
     PCRE supports partial matching by means of the
      PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT and PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD options, which can be
      set when calling any of the matching functions. For backwards
      compatibility, PCRE_PARTIAL is a synonym for
      PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT. The essential difference between the two
      options is whether or not a partial match is preferred to an
      alternative complete match, though the details differ between
      the two types of matching function. If both options are set,
      PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD takes precedence.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you want to use partial matching with just-in-time
      optimized code, you must call
     <code class="function">
      pcre_study
     </code>
     (),
     <code class="function">
      pcre16_study
     </code>
     () or
     <code class="function">
      pcre32_study
     </code>
     () with one or both of these
      options:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 PCRE_STUDY_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT_COMPILE
 PCRE_STUDY_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD_COMPILE
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE should also be set if you are going
      to run non-partial matches on the same pattern. If the
      appropriate JIT study mode has not been set for a match, the
      interpretive matching code is used.
    </p>
    <p>
     Setting a partial matching option disables two of PCRE's
      standard optimizations. PCRE remembers the last literal data
      unit in a pattern, and abandons matching immediately if it is
      not present in the subject string. This optimization cannot
      be used for a subject string that might match only partially.
      If the pattern was studied, PCRE knows the minimum length of
      a matching string, and does not bother to run the matching
      function on shorter strings. This optimization is also
      disabled for partial matching.

     A partial match occurs during a call to
     <code class="function">
      pcre_exec
     </code>
     () or
     <code class="function">
      pcre[16|32]_exec
     </code>
     () when the end of the
      subject string is reached successfully, but matching cannot
      continue because more characters are needed. However, at
      least one character in the subject must have been inspected.
      This character need not form part of the final matched
      string; lookbehind assertions and the \K escape sequence
      provide ways of inspecting characters before the start of a
      matched substring. The requirement for inspecting at least
      one character exists because an empty string can always be
      matched; without such a restriction there would always be a
      partial match of an empty string at the end of the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
     If there are at least two slots in the offsets vector when
      a partial match is returned, the first slot is set to the
      offset of the earliest character that was inspected. For
      convenience, the second offset points to the end of the
      subject so that a substring can easily be identified. If
      there are at least three slots in the offsets vector, the
      third slot is set to the offset of the character where
      matching started.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the majority of patterns, the contents of the first
      and third slots will be the same. However, for patterns that
      contain lookbehind assertions, or begin with \b or \B,
      characters before the one where matching started may have
      been inspected while carrying out the match. For example,
      consider this pattern:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/(?&lt;=abc)123/
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     This pattern matches "123", but only if it is preceded by
      "abc". If the subject string is "xyzabc12", the first two
      offsets after a partial match are for the substring "abc12",
      because all these characters were inspected. However, the
      third offset is set to 6, because that is the offset where
      matching began.
    </p>
    <p>
     What happens when a partial match is identified depends on
      which of the two partial matching options are set.

      () identifies a partial
        match, the partial match is remembered, but matching
        continues as normal, and other alternatives in the pattern
        are tried. If no complete match can be found,
        PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned instead of
        PCRE_ERROR_NOMATCH.
     </p>
     <p>
      This option is "soft" because it prefers a complete
        match over a partial match. All the various matching items
        in a pattern behave as if the subject string is potentially
        complete. For example, \z, \Z, and $ match at the end of
        the subject, as normal, and for \b and \B the end of the
        subject is treated as a non-alphanumeric.
     </p>
     <p>
      If there is more than one partial match, the first one
        that was found provides the data that is returned. Consider
        this pattern:

     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/123\w+X|dogY/
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      If this is matched against the subject string
        "abc123dog", both alternatives fail to match, but the end
        of the subject is reached during matching, so
        PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned. The offsets are set to 3
        and 9, identifying "123dog" as the first partial match that
        was found. (In this example, there are two partial matches,
        because "dog" on its own partially matches the second
        alternative.)

      (), PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL is
        returned as soon as a partial match is found, without
        continuing to search for possible complete matches. This
        option is "hard" because it prefers an earlier partial
        match over a later complete match. For this reason, the
        assumption is made that the end of the supplied subject
        string may not be the true end of the available data, and
        so, if \z, \Z, \b, \B, or $ are encountered at the end of
        the subject, the result is PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL, provided
        that at least one character in the subject has been
        inspected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Setting PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD also affects the way UTF-8 and
        UTF-16 subject strings are checked for validity. Normally,
        an invalid sequence causes the error PCRE_ERROR_BADUTF8 or
        PCRE_ERROR_BADUTF16. However, in the special case of a
        truncated character at the end of the subject,
        PCRE_ERROR_SHORTUTF8 or PCRE_ERROR_SHORTUTF16 is returned
        when PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set.

     <h3>
      Comparing hard and soft partial matching
     </h3>
     <p>
      The difference between the two partial matching options
        can be illustrated by a pattern such as:
     </p>
     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/dog(sbody)?/
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      This matches either "dog" or "dogsbody", greedily (that
        is, it prefers the longer string if possible). If it is
        matched against the string "dog" with PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT, it
        yields a complete match for "dog". However, if
        PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set, the result is PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL.
        On the other hand, if the pattern is made ungreedy the
        result is different:
     </p>
     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/dog(sbody)??/
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      In this case the result is always a complete match
        because that is found first, and matching never continues
        after finding a complete match. It might be easier to
        follow this explanation by thinking of the two patterns
        like this:
     </p>
     <div class="informalexample">
      <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 /dog(sbody)?/    is the same as  /dogsbody|dog/
 /dog(sbody)??/   is the same as  /dog|dogsbody/
</pre>
     </div>
     <p>
      The second pattern will never match "dogsbody", because
        it will always find the shorter match first.
     </p>
    </div>
   </div>
   <div class="refsect1">

    <h2>
     PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre_dfa_exec() OR
      pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()
    </h2>
    <p>
     The DFA functions move along the subject string character
      by character, without backtracking, searching for all
      possible matches simultaneously. If the end of the subject is
      reached before the end of the pattern, there is the
      possibility of a partial match, again provided that at least
      one character has been inspected.
    </p>
    <p>
     When PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT is set, PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL is
      returned only if there have been no complete matches.
      Otherwise, the complete matches are returned. However, if
      PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set, a partial match takes precedence
      over any complete matches. The portion of the string that was
      inspected when the longest partial match was found is set as
      the first matching string, provided there are at least two
      slots in the offsets vector.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because the DFA functions always search for all possible
      matches, and there is no difference between greedy and
      ungreedy repetition, their behaviour is different from the
      standard functions when PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set. Consider
      the string "dog" matched against the ungreedy pattern shown
      above:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/dog(sbody)??/
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     Whereas the standard functions stop as soon as they find
      the complete match for "dog", the DFA functions also find the
      partial match for "dogsbody", and so return that when
      PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD is set.

    <h2>
     PARTIAL MATCHING AND WORD BOUNDARIES
    </h2>
    <p>
     If a pattern ends with one of sequences \b or \B, which
      test for word boundaries, partial matching with
      PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT can give counter-intuitive results.
      Consider this pattern:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
/\bcat\b/
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     This matches "cat", provided there is a word boundary at
      either end. If the subject string is "the cat", the
      comparison of the final "t" with a following character cannot
      take place, so a partial match is found. However, normal
      matching carries on, and \b matches at the end of the subject
      when the last character is a letter, so a complete match is
      found. The result, therefore, is
     <span class="emphasis">
      <em>
       not
      </em>
     </span>
     PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL. Using
      PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD in this case does yield PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL,
      because then the partial match takes precedence.

     FORMERLY RESTRICTED PATTERNS

    <p>
     For releases of PCRE prior to 8.00, because of the way
      certain internal optimizations were implemented in the
     <code class="function">
      pcre_exec

     () function, the
      PCRE_PARTIAL option (predecessor of PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT) could

    <p>
     When a partial match has been found using a DFA matching
      function, it is possible to continue the match by providing
      additional subject data and calling the function again with
      the same compiled regular expression, this time setting the
      PCRE_DFA_RESTART option. You must pass the same working space
      as before, because this is where details of the previous
      partial match are stored. Here is an example using
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcretest
      </strong>
     </span>
     , using
      the \R escape sequence to set the PCRE_DFA_RESTART option (\D
      specifies the use of the DFA matching function):
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
 data&gt; 23ja\P\D
 Partial match: 23ja
 data&gt; n05\R\D
  0: n05
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     The first call has "23ja" as the subject, and requests
      partial matching; the second call has "n05" as the subject
      for the continued (restarted) match. Notice that when the
      match is complete, only the last part is shown; PCRE does not
      retain the previously partially-matched string. It is up to
      the calling program to do that if it needs to.
    </p>
    <p>
     That means that, for an unanchored pattern, if a continued
      match fails, it is not possible to try again at a new
      starting point. All this facility is capable of doing is
      continuing with the previous match attempt. In the previous
      example, if the second set of data is "ug23" the result is no
      match, even though there would be a match for "aug23" if the
      entire string were given at once. Depending on the
      application, this may or may not be what you want. The only
      way to allow for starting again at the next character is to
      retain the matched part of the subject and try a new complete
      match.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can set the PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT or PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD
      options with PCRE_DFA_RESTART to continue partial matching
      over multiple segments. This facility can be used to pass
      very long subject strings to the DFA matching functions.

     From release 8.00, the standard matching functions can
      also be used to do multi-segment matching. Unlike the DFA
      functions, it is not possible to restart the previous match
      with a new segment of data. Instead, new data must be added
      to the previous subject string, and the entire match re-run,
      starting from the point where the partial match occurred.
      Earlier data can be discarded.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is best to use PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD in this situation,
      because it does not treat the end of a segment as the end of
      the subject when matching \z, \Z, \b, \B, and $. Consider an
      unanchored pattern that matches dates:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d/
 data&gt; The date is 23ja\P\P
 Partial match: 23ja
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     At this stage, an application could discard the text
      preceding "23ja", add on text from the next segment, and call
      the matching function again. Unlike the DFA matching
      functions, the entire matching string must always be
      available, and the complete matching process occurs for each
      call, so more memory and more processing time is needed.

         If the pattern contains lookbehind assertions, or

              returned for a partial match includes characters that
              precede the start of what would be returned for a
              complete match, because it contains all the
              characters that were inspected during the partial
              match.

     ISSUES WITH MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING
    </h2>
    <p>
     Certain types of pattern may give problems with
      multi-segment matching, whichever matching function is
      used.
    </p>
    <p>
     1. If the pattern contains a test for the beginning of a
      line, you need to pass the PCRE_NOTBOL option when the
      subject string for any call does start at the beginning of a
      line. There is also a PCRE_NOTEOL option, but in practice
      when doing multi-segment matching you should be using
      PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD, which includes the effect of
      PCRE_NOTEOL.
    </p>
    <p>
     2. Lookbehind assertions that have already been obeyed are
      catered for in the offsets that are returned for a partial
      match. However a lookbehind assertion later in the pattern
      could require even earlier characters to be inspected. You
      can handle this case by using the PCRE_INFO_MAXLOOKBEHIND
      option of the
     <code class="function">
      pcre_fullinfo
     </code>
     ()
      or
     <code class="function">
      pcre[16|32]_fullinfo
     </code>
     ()
      functions to obtain the length of the longest lookbehind in
      the pattern. This length is given in characters, not bytes.
      If you always retain at least that many characters before the
      partially matched string, all should be well. (Of course,
      near the start of the subject, fewer characters may be
      present; in that case all characters should be retained.)
    </p>
    <p>
     From release 8.33, there is a more accurate way of
      deciding which characters to retain. Instead of subtracting
      the length of the longest lookbehind from the earliest
      inspected character (
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       offsets[0]
      </code>
     </em>
     ), the match start
      position (
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       offsets[2]
      </code>
     </em>
     ) should be used,
      and the next match attempt started at the
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       offsets[2]
      </code>
     </em>
     character by
      setting the
     <code class="function">
      startoffset
     </code>
     argument of
     <code class="function">
      pcre_exec
     </code>
     () or
     <code class="function">
      pcre_dfa_exec
     </code>
     ().
    </p>
    <p>
     For example, if the pattern "(?&lt;=123)abc" is partially
      matched against the string "xx123a", the three offset values
      returned are 2, 6, and 5. This indicates that the matching
      process that gave a partial match started at offset 5, but
      the characters "123a" were all inspected. The maximum
      lookbehind for that pattern is 3, so taking that away from 5
      shows that we need only keep "123a", and the next match
      attempt can be started at offset 3 (that is, at "a") when
      further characters have been added. When the match start is
      not the earliest inspected character,
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcretest
      </strong>
     </span>
     shows it
      explicitly:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; "(?&lt;=123)abc"
 data&gt; xx123a\P\P
 Partial match at offset 5: 123a
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     3. Because a partial match must always contain at least
      one character, what might be considered a partial match of an
      empty string actually gives a "no match" result. For
      example:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /c(?&lt;=abc)x/
 data&gt; ab\P
 No match
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     If the next segment begins "cx", a match should be found,
      but this will only happen if characters from the previous
      segment are retained. For this reason, a "no match" result
      should be interpreted as "partial match of an empty string"
      when the pattern contains lookbehinds.
    </p>
    <p>
     4. Matching a subject string that is split into multiple
      segments may not always produce exactly the same result as
      matching over one single long string, especially when
      PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT is used. The section "Partial Matching and
      Word Boundaries" above describes an issue that arises if the
      pattern ends with \b or \B. Another kind of difference may
      occur when there are multiple matching possibilities, because
      (for PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT) a partial match result is given only
      when there are no completed matches. This means that as soon
      as the shortest match has been found, continuation to a new
      subject segment is no longer possible. Consider again this
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       pcretest
      </strong>
     </span>
     example:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /dog(sbody)?/
 data&gt; dogsb\P
  0: dog
 data&gt; do\P\D
 Partial match: do
 data&gt; gsb\R\P\D
  0: g
 data&gt; dogsbody\D
  0: dogsbody
  1: dog
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     The first data line passes the string "dogsb" to a
      standard matching function, setting the PCRE_PARTIAL_SOFT
      option. Although the string is a partial match for
      "dogsbody", the result is not PCRE_ERROR_PARTIAL, because the
      shorter string "dog" is a complete match. Similarly, when the
      subject is presented to a DFA matching function in several
      parts ("do" and "gsb" being the first two) the match stops
      when "dog" has been found, and it is not possible to
      continue. On the other hand, if "dogsbody" is presented as a
      single string, a DFA matching function finds both
      matches.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because of these problems, it is best to use
      PCRE_PARTIAL_HARD when matching multi-segment data. The
      example above then behaves differently:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /dog(sbody)?/
 data&gt; dogsb\P\P
 Partial match: dogsb
 data&gt; do\P\D
 Partial match: do
 data&gt; gsb\R\P\P\D
 Partial match: gsb
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     5. Patterns that contain alternatives at the top level
      which do not all start with the same pattern item may not
      work as expected when PCRE_DFA_RESTART is used. For example,
      consider this pattern:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
1234|3789
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     If the first part of the subject is "ABC123", a partial
      match of the first alternative is found at offset 3. There is
      no partial match for the second alternative, because such a
      match does not start at the same point in the subject string.
      Attempting to continue with the string "7890" does not yield
      a match because only those alternatives that match at one
      point in the subject are remembered. The problem arises
      because the start of the second alternative matches within
      the first alternative. There is no problem with anchored
      patterns or patterns such as:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
1234|ABCD
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     where no string can be a partial match for both
      alternatives. This is not a problem if a standard matching
      function is used, because the entire match has to be rerun
      each time:
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   re&gt; /1234|3789/
 data&gt; ABC123\P\P
 Partial match: 123
 data&gt; 1237890
  0: 3789
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     Of course, instead of using PCRE_DFA_RESTART, the same
      technique of re-running the entire match can also be used
      with the DFA matching functions. Another possibility is to
      work with two buffers. If a partial match at offset
     <code class="literal">
      n
     </code>
     in the first buffer is
      followed by "no match" when PCRE_DFA_RESTART is used on the
      second buffer, you can then try a new match starting at
      offset
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       n+1
      </code>
     </em>
     in the
      first buffer.
