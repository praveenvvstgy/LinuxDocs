     script that can be used to build
      the library in Unix-like environments using the applications
      known as Autotools. Also in the distribution are files to

     BUILDING 8-BIT, 16-BIT AND 32-BIT LIBRARIES

    <p>
     By default, a library called

      libpcre

     is built, containing functions that
      take string arguments contained in vectors of bytes, either
      as single-byte characters, or interpreted as UTF-8 strings.
      You can also build a separate library, called
     <code class="function">
      libpcre16
     </code>
     , in which strings are contained
      in vectors of 16-bit data units and interpreted either as

      You can also build yet another separate library, called

     , in which strings are
      contained in vectors of 32-bit data units and interpreted

    <p>
     By default, if the 8-bit library is being built, the

     </code>
     script will search
      for a C++ compiler and C++ header files. If it finds them, it

    <h2>
     UTF-8, UTF-16 AND UTF-32 SUPPORT
    </h2>
    <p>
     To build PCRE with support for UTF Unicode character
      strings, add
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-utf
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     to the
     <code class="filename">
      configure
     </code>
     command.
      This setting applies to all three libraries, adding support
      for UTF-8 to the 8-bit library, support for UTF-16 to the
      16-bit library, and support for UTF-32 to the to the 32-bit
      library. There are no separate options for enabling UTF-8,
      UTF-16 and UTF-32 independently because that would allow
      ridiculous settings such as requesting UTF-16 support while
      building only the 8-bit library. It is not possible to build
      one library with UTF support and another without in the same
      configuration. (For backwards compatibility, --enable-utf8 is
      a synonym of --enable-utf.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Of itself, this setting does not make PCRE treat strings
      as UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32. As well as compiling PCRE with
      this option, you also have have to set the PCRE_UTF8,
      PCRE_UTF16 or PCRE_UTF32 option (as appropriate) when you
      call one of the pattern compiling functions.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you set --enable-utf when compiling in an EBCDIC
      environment, PCRE expects its input to be either ASCII or
      UTF-8 (depending on the run-time option). It is not possible
      to support both EBCDIC and UTF-8 codes in the same version of
      the library. Consequently, --enable-utf and --enable-ebcdic
      are mutually exclusive.

    <h2>
     UNICODE CHARACTER PROPERTY SUPPORT
    </h2>
    <p>
     UTF support allows the libraries to process character
      codepoints up to 0x10ffff in the strings that they handle. On
      its own, however, it does not provide any facilities for
      accessing the properties of such characters. If you want to
      be able to use the pattern escapes \P, \p, and \X, which
      refer to Unicode character properties, you must add
    </p>

    <p>
     to the
     <code class="filename">
      configure

     command.
      This implies UTF support, even if you have not explicitly
      requested it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Including Unicode property support adds around 30K of
      tables to the PCRE library. Only the general category

     CODE VALUE OF NEWLINE

    <p>
     By default, PCRE interprets the linefeed (LF) character as

      character on Unix-like systems. You can compile PCRE to use
      carriage return (CR) instead, by adding

      There is also a --enable-newline-is-lf option, which
      explicitly specifies linefeed as the newline character.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alternatively, you can specify that line endings are to be
      indicated by the two character sequence CRLF. If you want
      this, add

      holding the pointers to capturing substrings, because PCRE
      requires three integers per substring, whereas the POSIX
      interface provides only two. If the number of expected
      substrings is small, the wrapper function uses space on the
      stack, because this is faster than using
     <code class="function">
      malloc

     () for each call. The default

    <h2>
     HANDLING VERY LARGE PATTERNS
    </h2>
    <p>
     Within a compiled pattern, offset values are used to point
      from one part to another (for example, from an opening
      parenthesis to an alternation metacharacter). By default, in
      the 8-bit and 16-bit libraries, two-byte values are used for
      these offsets, leading to a maximum size for a compiled
      pattern of around 64K. This is sufficient to handle all but
      the most gigantic patterns. Nevertheless, some people do want
      to process truly enormous patterns, so it is possible to
      compile PCRE to use three-byte or four-byte offsets by adding
      a setting such as
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--with-link-size=3
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     to the
     <code class="filename">
      configure
     </code>
     command.
      The value given must be 2, 3, or 4. For the 16-bit library, a
      value of 3 is rounded up to 4. In these libraries, using
      longer offsets slows down the operation of PCRE because it
      has to load additional data when handling them. For the
      32-bit library the value is always 4 and cannot be
      overridden; the value of --with-link-size is ignored.

    <p>
     When matching with the
     <code class="function">
      pcre_exec

      backtracking by making recursive calls to an internal
      function called
     <code class="function">
      match
     </code>
     (). In
      environments where the size of the stack is limited, this can
      severely limit PCRE's operation. (The Unix environment does
      not usually suffer from this problem, but it may sometimes be
      necessary to increase the maximum stack size. There is a
      discussion in the
     <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrestack.3.html" shape="rect" target="_top">

      uses memory from the heap to remember data, instead of using

     <code class="function">

     () and
     <code class="function">

      pcre_malloc

     and
     <code class="function">
      pcre_free

     because the usage is very
      predictable: the block sizes requested are always the same,
      and the blocks are always freed in reverse order. A calling
      program might be able to implement optimized functions that
      perform better than

     ()
      and

    <h2>
     LIMITING PCRE RESOURCE USAGE
    </h2>
    <p>
     Internally, PCRE has a function called
     <code class="function">
      match
     </code>
     (), which it calls repeatedly
      (sometimes recursively) when matching a pattern with the
     <code class="function">
      pcre_exec
     </code>
     () function. By
      controlling the maximum number of times this function may be
      called during a single matching operation, a limit can be
      placed on the resources used by a single call to
     <code class="function">
      pcre_exec
     </code>
     (). The limit can be changed at
      run time, as described in the
     <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcreapi.3.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
      <span class="citerefentry">
       <span class="refentrytitle">

       </span>
       (3)
      </span>
     </a>
     documentation.
      The default is 10 million, but this can be changed by adding
      a setting such as
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--with-match-limit=500000
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     to the
     <code class="filename">
      configure
     </code>
     command.
      This setting has no effect on the
     <code class="function">
      pcre_dfa_exec
     </code>
     () matching function.
    </p>
    <p>
     In some environments it is desirable to limit the depth of
      recursive calls of
     <code class="function">
      match
     </code>
     () more
      strictly than the total number of calls, in order to restrict
      the maximum amount of stack (or heap, if
      --disable-stack-for-recursion is specified) that is used. A
      second limit controls this; it defaults to the value that is
      set for --with-match-limit, which imposes no additional
      constraints. However, you can set a lower limit by adding,
      for example,
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--with-match-limit-recursion=10000

    <p>

     <code class="filename">

     CREATING CHARACTER TABLES AT BUILD TIME
    </h2>
    <p>
     PCRE uses fixed tables for processing characters whose
      code values are less than 256. By default, PCRE is built with
      a set of tables that are distributed in the file
     <em class="replaceable">
      <code>
       pcre_chartables.c.dist
      </code>
     </em>
     . These
      tables are for ASCII codes only. If you add
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-rebuild-chartables
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     to the
     <code class="filename">
      configure
     </code>
     command,
      the distributed tables are no longer used. Instead, a program
      called
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       dftables
      </strong>
     </span>
     is compiled and run. This outputs the source for new set of
      tables, created in the default locale of your C run-time
      system. (This method of replacing the tables does not work if
      you are cross compiling, because
     <span class="command">
      <strong>
       dftables
      </strong>
     </span>
     is run on the
      local host. If you need to create alternative tables when
      cross compiling, you will have to do so "by hand".)

    <h2>
     USING EBCDIC CODE
    </h2>
    <p>
     PCRE assumes by default that it will run in an environment
      where the character code is ASCII (or Unicode, which is a
      superset of ASCII). This is the case for most computer
      operating systems. PCRE can, however, be compiled to run in
      an EBCDIC environment by adding
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-ebcdic
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     to the
     <code class="filename">
      configure
     </code>
     command.
      This setting implies --enable-rebuild-chartables. You should
      only use it if you know that you are in an EBCDIC environment
      (for example, an IBM mainframe operating system). The
      --enable-ebcdic option is incompatible with --enable-utf.
    </p>
    <p>
     The EBCDIC character that corresponds to an ASCII LF is
      assumed to have the value 0x15 by default. However, in some
      EBCDIC environments, 0x25 is used. In such an environment you
      should use
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">
     <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
--enable-ebcdic-nl25
</pre>
    </div>
    <p>
     as well as, or instead of, --enable-ebcdic. The EBCDIC
      character for CR has the same value as in ASCII, namely,
      0x0d. Whichever of 0x15 and 0x25 is
     <span class="emphasis">
      <em>
       not
      </em>
     </span>
     chosen as LF is made to
      correspond to the Unicode NEL character (which, in Unicode,
      is 0x85).
    </p>
    <p>
     The options that select newline behaviour, such as
      --enable-newline-is-cr, and equivalent run-time options,
      refer to these character values in an EBCDIC environment.

      However, in some environments (e.g. if an unmodified

     CODE COVERAGE REPORTING

    <p>
     If your C compiler is gcc, you can build a version of PCRE
      that can generate a code coverage report for its test suite.
      To enable this, you must install
     <code class="function">
      lcov
     </code>
     version 1.6 or above. Then specify
    </p>
    <div class="informalexample">

      configure

     command and
      build PCRE in the usual way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Note that using
     <code class="function">
      ccache
     </code>
     (a
      caching C compiler) is incompatible with code coverage
      reporting. If you have configured
     <code class="function">
