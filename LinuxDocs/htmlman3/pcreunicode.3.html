      release 8.30) and UTF-32 (from release 8.32), by means of two

    <p>
     In order process UTF-8 strings, you must build PCRE's

      sequence (*UTF8) or (*UTF). When either of these is the case,
      both the pattern and any subject strings that are matched
      against it are treated as UTF-8 strings instead of strings of
      individual 1-byte characters.

     UTF-16 AND UTF-32 SUPPORT
    </h2>
    <p>
     In order process UTF-16 or UTF-32 strings, you must build
      PCRE's 16-bit or 32-bit library with UTF support, and, in
      addition, you must call

      Alternatively, the pattern must start with the sequence
      (*UTF16), (*UTF32), as appropriate, or (*UTF), which can be
      used with either library. When UTF mode is set, both the
      pattern and any subject strings that are matched against it
      are treated as UTF-16 or UTF-32 strings instead of strings of

    <p>
     If you compile PCRE with UTF support, but do not use it at

     If PCRE is built with Unicode character property support

     <h3>
      Validity of UTF-8 strings
     </h3>
     <p>
      When you set the PCRE_UTF8 flag, the byte strings passed
        as patterns and subjects are (by default) checked for
        validity on entry to the relevant functions. The entire
        string is checked before any other processing takes place.
        From release 7.3 of PCRE, the check is according the rules
        of RFC 3629, which are themselves derived from the Unicode
        specification. Earlier releases of PCRE followed the rules
        of RFC 2279, which allows the full range of 31-bit values
        (0 to 0x7FFFFFFF). The current check allows only values in
        the range U+0 to U+10FFFF, excluding the surrogate area.
        (From release 8.33 the so-called "non-character" code
        points are no longer excluded because Unicode corrigendum
        #9 makes it clear that they should not be.)
     </p>
     <p>
      Characters in the "Surrogate Area" of Unicode are
        reserved for use by UTF-16, where they are used in pairs to
        encode codepoints with values greater than 0xFFFF. The code
        points that are encoded by UTF-16 pairs are available
        independently in the UTF-8 and UTF-32 encodings. (In other
        words, the whole surrogate thing is a fudge for UTF-16
        which unfortunately messes up UTF-8 and UTF-32.)
     </p>
     <p>
      If an invalid UTF-8 string is passed to PCRE, an error
        return is given. At compile time, the only additional
        information is the offset to the first byte of the failing
        character. The run-time functions
      <code class="function">
       pcre_exec
      </code>
      () and
      <code class="function">
       pcre_dfa_exec
      </code>
      () also pass back this
        information, as well as a more detailed reason code if the
        caller has provided memory in which to do this.
     </p>
     <p>
      In some situations, you may already know that your
        strings are valid, and therefore want to skip these checks
        in order to improve performance, for example in the case of
        a long subject string that is being scanned repeatedly. If
        you set the PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK flag at compile time or at
        run time, PCRE assumes that the pattern or subject it is
        given (respectively) contains only valid UTF-8 codes. In
        this case, it does not diagnose an invalid UTF-8
        string.
     </p>
     <p>
      Note that passing PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK to
      <code class="function">
       pcre_compile
      </code>
      () just disables the check
        for the pattern; it does not also apply to subject strings.
        If you want to disable the check for a subject string you
        must pass this option to
      <code class="function">
       pcre_exec
      </code>
      () or
      <code class="function">
       pcre_dfa_exec
      </code>
      ().
     </p>
     <p>
      If you pass an invalid UTF-8 string when
        PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK is set, the result is undefined and your
        program may crash.

      Validity of UTF-16 strings
     </h3>
     <p>
      When you set the PCRE_UTF16 flag, the strings of 16-bit
        data units that are passed as patterns and subjects are (by
        default) checked for validity on entry to the relevant
        functions. Values other than those in the surrogate range
        U+D800 to U+DFFF are independent code points. Values in the
        surrogate range must be used in pairs in the correct
        manner.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an invalid UTF-16 string is passed to PCRE, an error
        return is given. At compile time, the only additional
        information is the offset to the first data unit of the
        failing character. The run-time functions

      When you set the PCRE_UTF32 flag, the strings of 32-bit
        data units that are passed as patterns and subjects are (by
        default) checked for validity on entry to the relevant

      General comments about UTF modes
     </h3>
     <p>
      1. Codepoints less than 256 can be specified in patterns
        by either braced or unbraced hexadecimal escape sequences
        (for example, \x{b3} or \xb3). Larger values have to use
        braced sequences.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Octal numbers up to \777 are recognized, and in UTF-8
        mode they match two-byte characters for values greater than
        \177.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. Repeat quantifiers apply to complete UTF characters,
        not to individual data units, for example: \x{100}{3}.
     </p>
     <p>
      4. The dot metacharacter matches one UTF character
        instead of a single data unit.
     </p>
     <p>
      5. The escape sequence \C can be used to match a single
        byte in UTF-8 mode, or a single 16-bit data unit in UTF-16
        mode, or a single 32-bit data unit in UTF-32 mode, but its
        use can lead to some strange effects because it breaks up
        multi-unit characters (see the description of \C in the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrepattern.3.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">
        <span class="refentrytitle">
         pcrepattern
        </span>
        (3)
       </span>
      </a>
      documentation). The use of \C is not supported in the
        alternative matching function
      <code class="function">
       pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec
      </code>
      (), nor is it
        supported in UTF mode by the JIT optimization of
      <code class="function">
       pcre[16|32]_exec
      </code>
      (). If JIT
        optimization is requested for a UTF pattern that contains
        \C, it will not succeed, and so the matching will be
        carried out by the normal interpretive function.
     </p>
     <p>
      6. The character escapes \b, \B, \d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and
        \W correctly test characters of any code value, but, by
        default, the characters that PCRE recognizes as digits,
        spaces, or word characters remain the same set as in
        non-UTF mode, all with values less than 256. This remains
        true even when PCRE is built to include Unicode property
        support, because to do otherwise would slow down PCRE in
        many common cases. Note in particular that this applies to
        \b and \B, because they are defined in terms of \w and \W.
        If you really want to test for a wider sense of, say,
        "digit", you can use explicit Unicode property tests such
        as \p{Nd}. Alternatively, if you set the PCRE_UCP option,
        the way that the character escapes work is changed so that
        Unicode properties are used to determine which characters
        match. There are more details in the section on generic
        character types in the
      <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcrepattern.3.html" shape="rect" target="_top">
       <span class="citerefentry">

       </span>
      </a>
      documentation.
     </p>
     <p>
      7. Similarly, characters that match the POSIX named
        character classes are all low-valued characters, unless the
        PCRE_UCP option is set.
     </p>
     <p>
      8. However, the horizontal and vertical white space
        matching escapes (\h, \H, \v, and \V) do match all the
        appropriate Unicode characters, whether or not PCRE_UCP is
        set.
     </p>
     <p>
      9. Case-insensitive matching applies only to characters
        whose values are less than 128, unless PCRE is built with
        Unicode property support. A few Unicode characters such as
        Greek sigma have more than two codepoints that are
        case-equivalent. Up to and including PCRE release 8.31,
        only one-to-one case mappings were supported, but later
        releases (with Unicode property support) do treat as
        case-equivalent all versions of characters such as Greek
        sigma.
