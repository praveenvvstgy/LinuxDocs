     SIZE AND OTHER LIMITATIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
     There are some size limitations in PCRE but it is hoped
      that they will never in practice be relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
     The maximum length of a compiled pattern is approximately
      64K data units (bytes for the 8-bit library, 16-bit units for
      the 16-bit library, and 32-bit units for the 32-bit library)
      if PCRE is compiled with the default internal linkage size,
      which is 2 bytes for the 8-bit and 16-bit libraries, and 4
      bytes for the 32-bit library. If you want to process regular
      expressions that are truly enormous, you can compile PCRE
      with an internal linkage size of 3 or 4 (when building the
      16-bit or 32-bit library, 3 is rounded up to 4). See the
     <code class="constant">
      README

     file in the source
      distribution and the

     documentation
      for details. In these cases the limit is substantially
      larger. However, the speed of execution is slower.
    </p>
    <p>
     All values in repeating quantifiers must be less than
      65536.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no limit to the number of parenthesized
      subpatterns, but there can be no more than 65535 capturing
      subpatterns. There is, however, a limit to the depth of
      nesting of parenthesized subpatterns of all kinds. This is
      imposed in order to limit the amount of system stack used at
      compile time. The limit can be specified when PCRE is built;
      the default is 250.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a limit to the number of forward references to
      subsequent subpatterns of around 200,000. Repeated forward
      references with fixed upper limits, for example, (?2){0,100}
      when subpattern number 2 is to the right, are included in the
      count. There is no limit to the number of backward
      references.
    </p>
    <p>
     The maximum length of name for a named subpattern is 32
      characters, and the maximum number of named subpatterns is
      10000.
    </p>
    <p>
     The maximum length of a name in a (*MARK), (*PRUNE),
      (*SKIP), or (*THEN) verb is 255 for the 8-bit library and
      65535 for the 16-bit and 32-bit libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
     The maximum length of a subject string is the largest
      positive number that an integer variable can hold. However,
      when using the traditional matching function, PCRE uses
      recursion to handle subpatterns and indefinite repetition.
      This means that the available stack space may limit the size
      of a subject string that can be processed by certain
      patterns. For a discussion of stack issues, see the
