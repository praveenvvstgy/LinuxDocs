     DESCRIPTION
    </h2>
    <p>
     The
     <code class="function">
      libblkid
     </code>
     library is used
      to identify block devices (disks) as to their content (e.g.
      filesystem type) as well as extracting additional information
      such as filesystem labels/volume names, unique
      identifiers/serial numbers. A common use is to allow use of
      LABEL= and UUID= tags instead of hard-coding specific block
      device names into configuration files.
    </p>
    <p>
     The low-level part of the library also allows to extract
      information about partitions and block device topology.
    </p>
    <p>
     The high-level part of the library keeps information about
      block devices in a cache file and is verified to still be
      valid before being returned to the user (if the user has read
      permission on the raw block device, otherwise not). The cache
      file also allows unprivileged users (normally anyone other
      than root, or those not in the "disk" group) to locate
      devices by label/id. The standard location of the cache file
      can be overridden by the environment variable BLKID_FILE.
    </p>
    <p>
     In situations where one is getting information about a
      single known device, it does not impact performance whether
      the cache is used or not (unless you are not able to read the
      block device directly).
    </p>
    <p>
     The high-level part of the library supports two methods to
      evaluate LABEL/UUID. It reads information directly from a
      block device or read information from /dev/disk/by-* udev
      symlinks. The udev is preferred method by default.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are dealing with multiple devices, use of the cache
      is highly recommended (even if empty) as devices will be
      scanned at most one time and the on-disk cache will be
      updated if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     In some cases (modular kernels), block devices are not
      even visible until after they are accessed the first time, so
      it is critical that there is some way to locate these devices
      without enumerating only visible devices, so the use of the
      cache file is
     <code class="function">
      required
     </code>
     in this
      situation.

     was written by

      from Ted Ts'o. The library was subsequently heavily modified
      by Ted Ts'o.

     The low-level probing code was rewritten by Karel Zak.
